\v 1 In my bed by night I sought him that my soule loued: I sought him, but I found him not.
\v 2 I will rise therefore nowe, and goe about in the citie, by the streetes and by the open places, and wil seeke him that my soule loueth: I sought him, but I found him not.
\v 3 The watchmen that went about the citie, found mee: to whome I said, Haue you seene him, whome my soule loueth?
\v 4 When I had past a litle from them, then I found him whom my soule loued: I tooke holde on him and left him not, till I had brought him vnto my mothers house into the chamber of her that conceiued me.
\v 5 I charge you, O daughters of Ierusalem, by the roes and by the hindes of the fielde, that ye stirre not vp, nor waken my loue vntill she please.
\v 6 Who is shee that commeth vp out of the wildernes like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrhe and incense, and with all the spices of the marchant?
\v 7 Beholde his bed, which is Salomons: threescore strong men are round about it, of the valiant men of Israel.
\v 8 They all handle the sworde, and are expert in warre, euery one hath his sword vpon his thigh for the feare by night.
\v 9 King Salomon made himselfe a palace of the trees of Lebanon.
\v 10 Hee made the pillars thereof of siluer, and the pauement thereof of gold, the hangings thereof of purple, whose middes was paued with the loue of the daughters of Ierusalem.
\v 11 Come forth, ye daughters of Zion, and behold the King Salomon with the crowne, wherewith his mother crowned him in ye day of his mariage, and in the day of the gladnes of his heart.
