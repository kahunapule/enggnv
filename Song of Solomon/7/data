\c 7

\v 1 Howe beautifull are thy goings with shooes, O princes daughter! the ioynts of thy thighs are like iewels: the worke of the hande of a cunning workeman.
\v 2 Thy nauel is as a round cuppe that wanteth not licour: thy belly is as an heape of wheat compassed about with lilies.
\v 3 Thy two breastes are as two young roes that are twinnes.
\v 4 Thy necke is like a towre of yuorie: thine eyes are like the fishe pooles in Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the towre of Lebanon, that looketh toward Damascus.
\v 5 Thine head vpon thee is as skarlet, and the bush of thine head like purple: the King is tyed in the rafters.
\v 6 Howe faire art thou, and howe pleasant art thou, O my loue, in pleasures!
\v 7 This thy stature is like a palme tree, and thy brestes like clusters.
\v 8 I saide, I will goe vp into the palme tree, I will take holde of her boughes: thy breastes shall nowe be like the clusters of the vine: and the sauour of thy nose like apples,
\v 9 And the roufe of thy mouth like good wine, which goeth straight to my welbeloued, and causeth the lippes of the ancient to speake.
\v 10 I am my welbeloueds, and his desire is toward mee.
\v 11 Come, my welbeloued, let vs go foorth into the fielde: let vs remaine in the villages.
\v 12 Let vs get vp early to the vines, let vs see if the vine florish, whether it hath budded the small grape, or whether the pomegranates florish: there will I giue thee my loue.
\v 13 The mandrakes haue giuen a smelll, and in our gates are all sweete things, new and olde: my welbeloued, I haue kept them for thee.
