\c 62

\v 1 For Zions sake I will not holde my tongue, and for Ierusalems sake I wil not rest, vntil the righteousnes thereof breake foorth as the light, and saluation thereof as a burning lampe.
\v 2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousnesse, and all Kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name.
\v 3 Thou shalt also be a crowne of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royall diademe in the hand of thy God.
\v 4 It shall no more be sayd vnto thee, Forsaken, neither shall it be said any more to thy land, Desolate, but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the Lord deliteth in thee, and thy land shall haue an husband.
\v 5 For as a yong man marieth a virgine, so shall thy sonnes marry thee: and as a bridegrome is glad of the bride, so shall thy God reioyce ouer thee.
\v 6 I haue set watchmen vpon thy walles, O Ierusalem, which all the day and all the night continually shall not cease: ye that are mindfull of the Lord, keepe not silence,
\v 7 And giue him no rest, till hee repaire and vntill hee set vp Ierusalem the prayse of the worlde.
\v 8 The Lord hath sworne by his right hand and by his strong arme, Surely I wil no more giue thy corne to be meate for thine enemies, and surely the sonnes of the strangers shall not drinke thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured.
\v 9 But they that haue gathered it, shall eate it, and prayse the Lord, and the gatherers thereof shall drinke it in the courtes of my Sanctuarie.
\v 10 Go through, go through the gates: prepare you the way for the people: cast vp, cast vp the way, and gather out the stones and set vp a standart for the people.
\v 11 Beholde, the Lord hath proclaimed vnto the endes of the world: tell the daughter Zion, Beholde, thy Sauiour commeth: beholde, his wages is with him, and his worke is before him.
\v 12 And they shall call them, The holy people, the redeemed of the Lord, and thou shalt be named, A citie sought out and not forsaken.
