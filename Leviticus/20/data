\c 20
\p
\v 1 And the Lord spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Thou shalt say also to the children of Israel, Whosoeuer he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that dwell in Israel, that giueth his children vnto Molech, he shall die the death, ye people of ye land shall stone him to death.
\v 3 And I will set my face against that man and cut him off from among his people, because he hath giuen his children vnto Molech, for to defile my Sanctuarie, and to pollute mine holy Name.
\v 4 And if the people of the lande hide their eyes, and winke at that man when he giueth his children vnto Molech, and kill him not,
\v 5 Then will I set my face against that man, and against his familie, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him to comit whoredome with Molech, from among their people.
\v 6 If any turne after such as worke with spirits, and after soothsayers, to go a whoring after them, then will I set my face against that person, and will cut him off from among his people.
\v 7 Sanctifie your selues therefore, and be holie, for I am the Lord your God.
\v 8 Keepe ye therefore mine ordinances, and doe them. I am the Lord which doeth sanctifie you.
\v 9 If there be any that curseth his father or his mother, he shall die the death: seeing hee hath cursed his father and his mother, his blood shalbe vpon him.
\v 10 And the man that committeth adulterie with another mans wife, because he hath comitted adulterie with his neighbours wife, the adulterer and the adulteresse shall die the death.
\v 11 And the man that lyeth with his fathers wife, because hee hath vncouered his fathers shame, they shall both dye: their blood shalbe vpon them.
\v 12 Also the man that lyeth with his daughter in lawe, they both shall dye the death, they haue wrought abomination, their blood shalbe vpon them.
\v 13 The man also that lyeth with the male, as one lyeth with a woman, they haue both committed abomination: they shall dye the death, their blood shalbe vpon them.
\v 14 Likewise he that taketh a wife and her mother, committeth wickednesse: they shall burne him and them with fire, that there be no wickednes among you.
\v 15 Also the man that lyeth with a beast, shall dye the death, and ye shall slay the beast.
\v 16 And if a woman come to any beast, and lye therewith, then thou shalt kill the woman and the beast: they shall die the death, their blood shalbe vpon them.
\v 17 Also the man that taketh his sister, his fathers daughter, or his mothers daughter, and seeth her shame and she seeth his shame, it is villenie: therefore they shall be cut off in the sight of their people, because he hath vncouered his sisters shame, he shall beare his iniquitie.
\v 18 The man also that lyeth with a woman hauing her disease, and vncouereth her shame, and openeth her fountaine, and she open the foutaine of her blood, they shall bee euen both cut off from among their people.
\v 19 Moreouer thou shalt not vncouer the shame of thy mothers sister, nor of thy fathers sister: because he hath vncouered his kin, they shall beare their iniquitie.
\v 20 Likewise the man that lyeth with his fathers brothers wife, and vncouereth his vncles shame: they shall beare their iniquitie, and shall die childlesse.
\v 21 So the man that taketh his brothers wife, committeth filthines, because he hath vncouered his brothers shame: they shalbe childles.
\v 22 Ye shall keepe therefore all mine ordinances and all my iudgements, and doe them, that the land, whither I bring you to dwel therein, spue you not out.
\v 23 Wherefore ye shall not walke in the maners of this nation which I cast out before you: for they haue committed all these things, therefore I abhorred them.
\v 24 But I haue saide vnto you, ye shall inherite their land, and I will giue it vnto you to possesse it, euen a land that floweth with milke and honie: I am the Lord your God, which haue separated you from other people.
\v 25 Therefore shall ye put difference betweene cleane beastes and vncleane, and betweene vncleane foules and cleane: neither shall ye defile your selues with beastes and foules, nor with any creeping thing, that ye ground bringeth forth, which I haue separated from you as vncleane.
\v 26 Therefore shall ye be holie vnto me: for I the Lord am holy, and I haue separated you from other people, that ye shoulde be mine.
\v 27 And if a man or woman haue a spirite of diuination, or soothsaying in them, they shall die the death: they shall stone them to death, their blood shalbe vpon them.
