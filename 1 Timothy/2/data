\c 2
\p
\v 1 I Exhort therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giuing of thanks be made for all men,
\v 2 For Kings, and for all that are in authoritie, that we may leade a quiet and a peaceable life, in all godlinesse and honestie.
\v 3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Sauiour,
\v 4 Who will that all men shalbe saued, and come vnto the acknowledging of the trueth.
\v 5 For there is one God, and one Mediatour betweene God and man, which is the man Christ Iesus,
\v 6 Who gaue himselfe a ransome for all men, to be that testimonie in due time,
\v 7 Whereunto I am ordeined a preacher and an Apostle (I speake the trueth in Christ, and lie not) euen a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and veritie.
\v 8 I will therefore that the men pray, euery where lifting vp pure hands without wrath, or douting.
\v 9 Likewise also the women, that they aray themselues in comely apparell, with shamefastnes and modestie, not with broyded heare, or gold, or pearles, or costly apparell,
\v 10 But (as becommeth women that professe the feare of God) with good workes.
\v 11 Let the woman learne in silence with all subiection.
\v 12 I permit not a woman to teache, neither to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man, but to be in silence.
\v 13 For Adam was first formed, then Eue.
\v 14 And Adam was not deceiued, but the woman was deceiued, and was in the transgression.
\v 15 Notwithstanding, through bearing of children she shalbe saued if they continue in faith, and loue, and holines with modestie.
