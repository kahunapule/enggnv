\c 4

\v 1 Now the Spirit speaketh euidently, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, and shall giue heede vnto spirits of errour, and doctrines of deuils,
\v 2 Which speake lies through hypocrisie, and haue their cosciences burned with an hote yron,
\v 3 Forbidding to marrie, and commanding to abstaine from meates which God hath created to be receiued with giuing thankes of them which beleeue and knowe the trueth.
\v 4 For euery creature of God is good, and nothing ought to be refused, if it be receiued with thankesgiuing.
\v 5 For it is sanctified by the worde of God, and prayer.
\v 6 If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Iesus Christ, which hast bene nourished vp in the wordes of faith, and of good doctrine, which thou hast continually followed.
\v 7 But cast away prophane, and olde wiues fables, and exercise thy selfe vnto godlinesse.
\v 8 For bodily exercise profiteth litle: but godlinesse is profitable vnto all things, which hath the promise of the life present, and of that that is to come.
\v 9 This is a true saying, and by all meanes worthie to be receiued.
\v 10 For therefore we labour and are rebuked, because we trust in the liuing God, which is the Sauiour of all men, specially of those that beleeue.
\v 11 These things warne and teache.
\v 12 Let no man despise thy youth, but be vnto them that beleeue, an ensample, in worde, in conuersation, in loue, in spirit, in faith, and in purenesse.
\v 13 Till I come, giue attendance to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine.
\v 14 Despise not the gift that is in thee, which was giuen thee by prophecie with the laying on of the hands of the companie of the Eldership.
\v 15 These things exercise, and giue thy selfe vnto them, that it may be seene howe thou profitest among all men.
\v 16 Take heede vnto thy selfe, and vnto learning: continue therein: for in doing this thou shalt both saue thy selfe, and them that heare thee.
