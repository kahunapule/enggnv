\v 1 And I heard a great voyce out of the Temple, saying to the seuen Angels, Go your wayes, and powre out the seuen vials of the wrath of God vpon the earth.
\v 2 And the first went and powred out his viall vpon the earth: and there fell a noysome, and a grieuous sore vpon the men, which had the marke of ye beast, and vpon them which worshipped his image.
\v 3 And the second Angel powred out his viall vpon the sea, and it became as the blood of a dead man: and euery liuing thing dyed in the sea.
\v 4 And the third Angel powred out his viall vpon the riuers and fountaines of waters, and they became blood.
\v 5 And I heard the Angel of the waters say, Lord, thou art iust, Which art, and Which wast: and Holy, because thou hast iudged these things.
\v 6 For they shed the blood of the Saints, and Prophets, and therefore hast thou giuen them blood to drinke: for they are worthy.
\v 7 And I heard another out of the Sanctuarie say, Euen so, Lord God almightie, true and righteous are thy iudgements.
\v 8 And the fourth Angel powred out his viall on the sunne, and it was giuen vnto him to torment men with heate of fire,
\v 9 And men boyled in great heate, and blasphemed the Name of God, which hath power ouer these plagues, and they repented not, to giue him glorie.
\v 10 And the fifth Angel powred out his viall vpon the throne of the beast, and his kingdome waxed darke, and they gnawed their tongues for sorowe,
\v 11 And blasphemed the God of heauen for their paines, and for their sores, and repented not of their workes.
\v 12 And the sixth Angel powred out his viall vpon the great riuer Euphrates, and the water thereof dried vp, that the way of the Kings of the East should be prepared.
\v 13 And I sawe three vncleane spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of that dragon, and out of the mouth of that beast, and out of the mouth of that false prophet.
\v 14 For they are the spirits of deuils, working miracles, to go vnto the Kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to gather them to the battell of that great day of God Almightie.
\v 15 (Beholde, I come as a theefe. Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments, least hee walke naked, and men see his filthines)
\v 16 And they gathered them together into a place called in Hebrewe Arma-gedon.
\v 17 And the seuenth Angel powred out his viall into the ayre: and there came a loude voyce out of the Temple of heauen from the throne, saying, It is done.
\v 18 And there were voyces, and thundrings, and lightnings, and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were vpon the earth, euen so mightie an earthquake.
\v 19 And the great citie was deuided into three partes, and the cities of the nations fell: and that great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to giue vnto her the cup of the wine of the fiercenesse of his wrath.
\v 20 And euery yle fled away, and the mountaines were not found.
\v 21 And there fell a great haile, like talents, out of heauen vpon the men, and men blasphemed God, because of the plague of the haile: for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
