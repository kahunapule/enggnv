\c 11
\p
\v 1 Cast thy bread vpon the waters: for after many daies thou shalt finde it.
\v 2 Giue a portion to seuen, and also to eight: for thou knowest not what euill shalbe vpon ye earth.
\v 3 If the clouds be full, they wil powre forth raine vpon the earth: and if the tree doe fall toward the South, or toward the North, in the place that the tree falleth, there it shalbe.
\v 4 He that obserueth ye winde, shall not sow, and he that regardeth the cloudes, shall not reape.
\v 5 As thou knowest not which is ye way of the spirit, nor how the bones doe growe in the wombe of her that is with child: so thou knowest not the worke of God that worketh all.
\v 6 In the morning sowe thy seede, and in the euening let not thine hand rest: for thou knowest not whither shall prosper, this or that, or whether both shalbe a like good.
\v 7 Surely the light is a pleasant thing: and it is a good thing to the eyes to see the sunne.
\v 8 Though a man liue many yeeres, and in them all he reioyce, yet hee shall remember the daies of darkenesse, because they are manie, all that commeth is vanitie.
\v 9 Reioyce, O yong man, in thy youth, and let thine heart cheere thee in the dayes of thy youth: and walke in the waies of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but knowe that for all these things, God wil bring thee to iudgement.
\v 10 Therefore take away griefe out of thine heart, and cause euil to depart from thy flesh: for childehood and youth are vanitie.
