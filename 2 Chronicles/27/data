\v 2 And hee did vprightly in the sight of the Lord according to all that his father Vzziah did, saue that hee entred not into the Temple of the Lord, and the people did yet corrupt their wayes.
\v 3 He buylt the hie gate of the house of the Lord, and he buylt very much on the wall of the castle.
\v 4 Moreouer hee buylt cities in the mountaines of Iudah, and in the forests he buylt palaces and towres.
