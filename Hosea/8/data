\c 8
\p
\v 1 Set the trumpet to thy mouth: he shall come as an eagle against the House of the Lord, because they haue transgressed my couenant, and trespassed against my Lawe.
\v 2 Israel shall crie vnto me, My God, we know thee.
\v 3 Israel hath cast off ye thing that is good: the enemie shall pursue him.
\v 4 They haue set vp a King, but not by me: they haue made princes, and I knew it not: of their siluer and their gold haue they made them idoles: therefore shall they be destroyed.
\v 5 Thy calfe, O Samaria, hath cast thee off: mine anger is kindled against them: howe long will they be without innocencie!
\v 6 For it came euen from Israel: the workeman made it, therefore it is not God: but the calfe of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
\v 7 For they haue sowne the winde, and they shall reape the whirlewind: it hath no stalke: the budde shall bring foorth no meale: if so be it bring forth, the strangers shall deuoure it.
\v 8 Israel is deuoured, now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessell wherein is no pleasure.
\v 9 For they are gone vp to Asshur: they are as a wilde asse alone by himselfe: Ephraim hath hired louers.
\v 10 Yet though they haue hired among the nations, nowe will I gather them, and they shall sorowe a litle, for the burden of the King and the princes.
\v 11 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sinne, his altars shalbe to sinne.
\v 12 I haue written to them the great things of my Lawe: but they were counted as a strange thing.
\v 13 They sacrifice flesh for ye sacrifices of mine offerings, and eate it: but the Lord accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquitie, and visite their sinnes: they shall returne to Egypt.
\v 14 For Israel hath forgotten his maker, and buildeth Temples, and Iudah hath increased strong cities: but I will sende a fire vpon his cities, and it shall deuoure the palaces thereof.
