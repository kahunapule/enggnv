\c 6
\p
\v 1 Come, and let vs returne to the Lord: for he hath spoyled, and he will heale vs: he hath wounded vs, and he will binde vs vp.
\v 2 After two dayes will he reuiue vs, and in the third day he will raise vs vp, and we shall liue in his sight.
\v 3 Then shall we haue knowledge, and indeuour our selues to know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning, and he shall come vnto vs as the raine, and as the latter raine vnto the earth.
\v 4 O Ephraim, what shall I doe vnto thee? O Iudah, how shall I intreate thee? for your goodnesse is as a morning cloude, and as the morning dewe it goeth away.
\v 5 Therefore haue I cut downe by the Prophets: I haue slaine them by the wordes of my mouth, and thy iudgements were as the light that goeth forth.
\v 6 For I desired mercie, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more then burnt offrings.
\v 7 But they like men haue transgressed the couenant: there haue they trespassed against me.
\v 8 Gilead is a citie of them that worke iniquitie, and is polluted with blood.
\v 9 And as the eues waite for a man, so the companie of Priestes murder in the way by consent: for they worke mischiefe.
\v 10 I haue seene vileny in the house of Israel: there is ye whoredome of Ephraim: Israel is defiled.
\v 11 Yea, Iudah hath set a plant for thee, whiles I woulde returne ye captiuitie of my people.
