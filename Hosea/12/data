\c 12

\v 1 Ephraim is fed with the winde, and followeth after the East winde: hee increaseth daily lies and destruction, and they do make a couenant with Asshur, and oyle is caried into Egypt.
\v 2 The Lord hath also a controuersie with Iudah, and will visite Iaakob, according to his waies: according to his workes, wil he recompence him.
\v 3 Hee tooke his brother by the heele in the wombe, and by his strength he had power with God,
\v 4 And had power ouer the Angel, and preuailed: he wept and praied vnto him: he founde him in Beth-el, and there he spake with vs.
\v 5 Yea, the Lord God of hostes, the Lord is himselfe his memoriall.
\v 6 Therefore turne thou to thy God: keepe mercy and iudgement, and hope still in thy God.
\v 7 He is Canaan: the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loueth to oppresse.
\v 8 And Ephraim saide, Notwithstanding I am rich, I haue found me out riches in all my labours: they shall finde none iniquitie in me, that were wickednesse.
\v 9 Though I am the Lord thy God, from the land of Egypt, yet will I make thee to dwel in the tabernacles, as in the daies of the solemne feast.
\v 10 I haue also spoken by the Prophets, and I haue multiplied visions, and vsed similitudes by the ministerie of the Prophets.
\v 11 Is there iniquitie in Gilead? surely they are vanitie: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal, and their altars are as heapes in the furrowes of the field.
\v 12 And Iaakob fled into the countrey of Aram, and Israel serued for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheepe.
\v 13 And by a Prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a Prophet was he reserued.
\v 14 But Ephraim prouoked him with hie places: therefore shall his blood be powred vpon him, and his reproche shall his Lord reward him.
