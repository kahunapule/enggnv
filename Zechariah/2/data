\c 2
\p
\v 1 I lift vp mine eyes againe and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.
\v 2 Then saide I, Whither goest thou? And he saide vnto me, To measure Ierusalem, that I may see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
\v 3 And beholde, the Angel that talked with me, went foorth: and another Angel went out to meete him,
\v 4 And saide vnto him, Runne, speake to this yong man, and say, Ierusalem shalbe inhabited without walles, for the multitude of men and cattell therein.
\v 5 For I, saith the Lord, will be vnto her a wall of fire round about, and wil be the glory in the middes of her.
\v 6 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the North, saith the Lord: for I haue scattered you into the foure winds of the heauen, saith ye Lord.
\v 7 Saue thy selfe, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babel.
\v 8 For thus saith the Lord of hostes, After this glory hath hee sent me vnto the nations, which spoyled you: for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.
\v 9 For beholde, I will lift vp mine hand vpon them: and they shalbe a spoyle to those that serued them, and ye shall knowe, that the Lord of hostes hath sent me.
\v 10 Reioyce, and be glad, O daughter Zion: for loe, I come, and will dwell in the middes of thee, saith the Lord.
\v 11 And many nations shall be ioyned to the Lord in that day, and shalbe my people: and I will dwell in the middes of thee, and thou shalt knowe that the Lord of hostes hath sent me vnto thee.
\v 12 And the Lord shall inherite Iudah his portion in the holy lande, and shall chuse Ierusalem againe.
\v 13 Let all flesh be still before the Lord: for he is raised vp out of his holy place.
