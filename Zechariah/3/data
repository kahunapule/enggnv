\v 1 And he shewed mee Iehoshua the hie Priest, standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan stoode at his right hand to resist him.
\v 2 And the Lord said vnto Satan, The Lord reprooue thee, O Satan: euen the Lord that hath chosen Ierusalem, reprooue thee. Is not this a brand taken out of the fire?
\v 3 Nowe Iehoshua was clothed with filthie garments, and stoode before the Angel.
\v 4 And he answered and spake vnto those that stoode before him, saying, Take away the filthie garments from him. And vnto him hee saide, Behold, I haue caused thine iniquitie to depart from thee, and I wil clothe thee with change of raiment.
\v 5 And I saide, Let them set a faire diademe vpon his head. So they set a faire diademe vpon his head, and clothed him with garments, and the Angel of the Lord stoode by.
\v 6 And the Angel of the Lord testified vnto Iehoshua, saying,
\v 7 Thus saith the Lord of hostes, If thou wilt walke in my wayes, and keepe my watch, thou shalt also iudge mine House, and shalt also keepe my courtes, and I will giue thee place among these that stand by.
\v 8 Heare now, O Iehoshua the hie Priest, thou and thy fellowes that sit before thee: for they are monstruous persons: but behold, I wil bring forth the Branche my seruant.
\v 9 For loe, the stone that I haue layd before Iehoshua: vpon one stone shalbe seuen eyes: beholde, I will cut out the grauing thereof, saith the Lord of hostes, and I will take away the iniquitie of this land in one day.
\v 10 In that day, saith the Lord of hostes, shall ye call euery man his neighbour vnder the vine, and vnder the figge tree.
