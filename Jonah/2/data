\v 1 Then Ionah prayed vnto the Lord his God out of the fishes belly,
\v 2 And said, I cryed in mine affliction vnto the Lord, and he heard me: out of the bellie of hell cryed I, and thou heardest my voyce.
\v 3 For thou haddest cast me into the bottome in the middes of the sea, and the floods compassed me about: all thy surges, and all thy waues passed ouer me.
\v 4 Then I saide, I am cast away out of thy sight: yet will I looke againe towarde thine holy Temple.
\v 5 The waters compassed me about vnto the soule: the depth closed me rounde about, and the weedes were wrapt about mine head.
\v 6 I went downe to the bottome of the moutaines: the earth with her barres was about me for euer, yet hast thou brought vp my life from the pit, O Lord my God.
\v 7 When my soule fainted within me, I remembred the Lord: and my prayer came vnto thee, into thine holy Temple.
\v 8 They that waite vpon lying vanities, forsake their owne mercie.
\v 9 But I will sacrifice vnto thee with the voice of thankesgiuing, and will pay that that I haue vowed: saluation is of the Lord.
\v 10 And the Lord spake vnto the fish, and it cast out Ionah vpon the dry lande.
