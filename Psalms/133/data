\c 133
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees or Psalme of David. Behold, howe good and howe comely a thing it is, brethren to dwell euen together.
\v 2 It is like to the precious oyntment vpon the head, that runneth downe vpon the beard, euen vnto Aarons beard, which went downe on the border of his garments:
\v 3 And as the dew of Hermon, which falleth vpon the mountaines of Zion: for there the Lord appointed the blessing and life for euer.
