\c 65

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme or song of David. O God, praise waiteth for thee in Zion, and vnto thee shall the vowe be perfourmed.
\v 2 Because thou hearest the prayer, vnto thee shall all flesh come.
\v 3 Wicked deedes haue preuailed against me: but thou wilt be mercifull vnto our transgressions.
\v 4 Blessed is he, whom thou chusest and causest to come to thee: he shall dwell in thy courtes, and we shall be satisfied with the pleasures of thine House, euen of thine holy Temple.
\v 5 O God of our saluation, thou wilt answere vs with fearefull signes in thy righteousnes, O thou the hope of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are farre off in the sea.
\v 6 He stablisheth the mountaines by his power: and is girded about with strength.
\v 7 He appeaseth the noyse of the seas and the noyse of the waues thereof, and the tumults of the people.
\v 8 They also, that dwell in the vttermost parts of the earth, shalbe afraide of thy signes: thou shalt make the East and the West to reioyce.
\v 9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou makest it very riche: the Riuer of God is full of water: thou preparest them corne: for so thou appointest it.
\v 10 Thou waterest abundantly the furrowes thereof: thou causest the raine to descende into the valleies thereof: thou makest it soft with showres, and blessest the bud thereof.
\v 11 Thou crownest ye yeere with thy goodnesse, and thy steppes droppe fatnesse.
\v 12 They drop vpon the pastures of the wildernesse: and the hils shalbe compassed with gladnes.
\v 13 The pastures are clad with sheepe: the valleis also shalbe couered with corne: therefore they shoute for ioye, and sing.
