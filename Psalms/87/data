\v 1 A Psalme or song committed to the sonnes of Korah. God layde his foundations among the holy mountaines.
\v 2 The Lord loueth the gates of Zion aboue all the habitations of Iaakob.
\v 3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O citie of God. Selah.
\v 4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babel among them that knowe me: beholde Palestina and Tyrus with Ethiopia, There is he borne.
\v 5 And of Zion it shall be sayde, Many are borne in her: and he, euen the most High shall stablish her.
\v 6 The Lord shall count, when hee writeth the people, He was borne there. Selah.
\v 7 Aswell the singers as the players on instruments shall prayse thee: all my springs are in thee.
