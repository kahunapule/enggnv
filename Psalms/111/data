\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. I will prayse the Lord with my whole heart in the assemblie and Congregation of the iust.
\v 2 The workes of the Lord are great, and ought to be sought out of al them that loue them.
\v 3 His worke is beautifull and glorious, and his righteousnesse endureth for euer.
\v 4 He hath made his wonderfull workes to be had in remembrance: the Lord is mercifull and full of compassion.
\v 5 He hath giuen a portion vnto them that feare him: he wil euer be mindfull of his couenant.
\v 6 He hath shewed to his people the power of his workes in giuing vnto them the heritage of the heathen.
\v 7 The workes of his handes are trueth and iudgement: all his statutes are true.
\v 8 They are stablished for euer and euer, and are done in trueth and equitie.
\v 9 He sent redemption vnto his people: he hath commanded his couenant for euer: holy and fearefull is his Name.
\v 10 The beginning of wisedome is the feare of the Lord: all they that obserue them, haue good vnderstanding: his praise endureth for euer.
