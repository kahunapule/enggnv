\c 120
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. I called vnto the Lord in my trouble, and hee heard me.
\v 2 Deliuer my soule, O Lord, from lying lippes, and from a deceitfull tongue.
\v 3 What doeth thy deceitfull tongue bring vnto thee? or what doeth it auaile thee?
\v 4 It is as the sharpe arrowes of a mightie man, and as the coales of iuniper.
\v 5 Woe is to me that I remaine in Meschech, and dwell in the tentes of Kedar.
\v 6 My soule hath too long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
\v 7 I seeke peace, and when I speake thereof, they are bent to warre.
