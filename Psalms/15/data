\c 15
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid. Lord, who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle? who shall rest in thine holy Mountaine?
\v 2 He that walketh vprightly and worketh righteousnes, and speaketh the trueth in his heart.
\v 3 He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth euill to his neighbour, nor receiueth a false report against his neighbour.
\v 4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoureth them that feare the Lord: he that sweareth to his owne hinderance and changeth not.
\v 5 He that giueth not his money vnto vsurie, nor taketh reward against the innocent: hee that doeth these things, shall neuer be moued.
