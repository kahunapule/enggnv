\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. Sing ye vnto the Lord a newe song: let his prayse be heard in the Congregation of Saints.
\v 2 Let Israel reioyce in him that made him, and let ye children of Zion reioyce in their King.
\v 3 Let them prayse his Name with the flute: let them sing prayses vnto him with the timbrell and harpe.
\v 4 For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: he will make the meeke glorious by deliuerance.
\v 5 Let ye Saints be ioyfull with glorie: let them sing loud vpon their beddes.
\v 6 Let the high Actes of God bee in their mouth, and a two edged sword in their hands,
\v 7 To execute vengeance vpon the heathen, and corrections among the people:
\v 8 To binde their Kings in chaines, and their nobles with fetters of yron,
\v 9 That they may execute vpon them the iudgement that is written: this honour shall be to all his Saintes. Prayse ye the Lord.
