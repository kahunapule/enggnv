\c 92
\p
\v 1 A Psalme or song for the Sabbath day. It is a good thing to praise the Lord, and to sing vnto thy Name, O most High,
\v 2 To declare thy louing kindenesse in the morning, and thy trueth in the night,
\v 3 Vpon an instrument of tenne strings, and vpon the viole with the song vpon the harpe.
\v 4 For thou, Lord, hast made mee glad by thy workes, and I wil reioyce in the workes of thine handes.
\v 5 O Lord, how glorious are thy workes! and thy thoughtes are very deepe.
\v 6 An vnwise man knoweth it not, and a foole doeth not vnderstand this,
\v 7 (When the wicked growe as the grasse, and all the workers of wickednesse doe flourish) that they shall be destroyed for euer.
\v 8 But thou, O Lord, art most High for euermore.
\v 9 For loe, thine enemies, O Lord: for loe, thine enemies shall perish: all the workers of iniquitie shall be destroyed.
\v 10 But thou shalt exalt mine horne, like the vnicornes, and I shalbe anoynted with fresh oyle.
\v 11 Mine eye also shall see my desire against mine enemies: and mine eares shall heare my wish against the wicked, that rise vp against me.
\v 12 The righteous shall flourish like a palme tree, and shall grow like a Cedar in Lebanon.
\v 13 Such as bee planted in the house of the Lord, shall flourish in the courtes of our God.
\v 14 They shall still bring foorth fruite in their age: they shall be fat and flourishing,
\v 15 To declare that the Lord my rocke is righteous, and that none iniquitie is in him.
