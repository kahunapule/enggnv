\c 95
\p
\v 1 Come, let vs reioyce vnto the Lord: let vs sing aloude vnto the rocke of our saluation.
\v 2 Let vs come before his face with praise: let vs sing loude vnto him with Psalmes.
\v 3 For the Lord is a great God, and a great King aboue all gods.
\v 4 In whose hande are the deepe places of the earth, and the heightes of the mountaines are his:
\v 5 To whome the Sea belongeth: for hee made it, and his handes formed the dry land.
\v 6 Come, let vs worship and fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our maker.
\v 7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheepe of his hande: to day, if ye will heare his voyce,
\v 8 Harden not your heart, as in Meribah, and as in the day of Massah in the wildernesse.
\v 9 Where your fathers tempted me, proued me, though they had seene my worke.
\v 10 Fourtie yeeres haue I contended with this generation, and said, They are a people that erre in heart, for they haue not knowen my wayes.
\v 11 Wherefore I sware in my wrath, saying, Surely they shall not enter into my rest.
