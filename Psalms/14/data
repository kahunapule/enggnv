\c 14

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The foole hath said in his heart, There is no God: they haue corrupted, and done an abominable worke: there is none that doeth good.
\v 2 The Lord looked downe from heauen vpon the children of men, to see if there were any that would vnderstand, and seeke God.
\v 3 All are gone out of the way: they are all corrupt: there is none that doeth good, no not one.
\v 4 Doe not all the workers of iniquitie know that they eate vp my people, as they eate bread? they call not vpon the Lord.
\v 5 There they shall be taken with feare, because God is in the generation of the iust.
\v 6 You haue made a mocke at the counsell of the poore, because the Lord is his trust.
\v 7 Oh giue saluation vnto Israel out of Zion: when the Lord turneth the captiuitie of his people, then Iaakob shall reioyce, and Israel shall be glad.
