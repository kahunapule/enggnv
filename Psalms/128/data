\c 128
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. Blessed is euery one that feareth the Lord and walketh in his wayes.
\v 2 When thou eatest the labours of thine hands, thou shalt be blessed, and it shall be well with thee.
\v 3 Thy wife shalbe as the fruitfull vine on the sides of thine house, and thy children like the oliue plantes round about thy table.
\v 4 Lo, surely thus shall the man be blessed, that feareth the Lord.
\v 5 The Lord out of Zion shall blesse thee, and thou shalt see the wealth of Ierusalem all the dayes of thy life.
\v 6 Yea, thou shalt see thy childrens children, and peace vpon Israel.
