\v 1 To him that excelleth. Destroy not. A Psalme of David on Michtam. When he fled from Saul in the cave. Have mercie vpon me, O God, haue mercie vpon me: for my soule trusteth in thee, and in the shadowe of thy wings wil I trust, till these afflictions ouerpasse.
\v 2 I will call vnto the most high God, euen to the God, that performeth his promise toward me.
\v 3 He will send from heauen, and saue me from the reproofe of him that would swallowe me. Selah. God wil send his mercy, and his trueth.
\v 4 My soule is among lions: I lie among the children of men, that are set on fire: whose teeth are speares and arrowes, and their tongue a sharpe sworde.
\v 5 Exalt thy selfe, O God, aboue the heauen, and let thy glory be vpon all the earth.
\v 6 They haue layd a net for my steps: my soule is pressed downe: they haue digged a pit before me, and are fallen into the mids of it. Selah.
\v 7 Mine heart is prepared, O God, mine heart is prepared: I will sing and giue prayse.
\v 8 Awake my tongue, awake viole and harpe: I wil awake early.
\v 9 I will prayse thee, O Lord, among the people, and I wil sing vnto thee among the nations.
\v 10 For thy mercie is great vnto the heauens, and thy trueth vnto the cloudes.
\v 11 Exalt thy selfe, O God, aboue the heauens, and let thy glory be vpon all the earth.
