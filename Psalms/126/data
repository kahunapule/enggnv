\c 126
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees, or Psalme of David. When ye Lord brought againe the captiuitie of Zion, we were like them that dreame.
\v 2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ioye: then sayd they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them.
\v 3 The Lord hath done great things for vs, whereof we reioyce.
\v 4 O Lord, bring againe our captiuitie, as the riuers in the South.
\v 5 They that sowe in teares, shall reape in ioy.
\v 6 They went weeping and caried precious seede: but they shall returne with ioye and bring their sheaues.
