\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David. O Lord, thou hast tried me and knowen me.
\v 2 Thou knowest my sitting and my rising: thou vnderstandest my thought afarre off.
\v 3 Thou compassest my pathes, and my lying downe, and art accustomed to all my wayes.
\v 4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but loe, thou knowest it wholy, O Lord.
\v 5 Thou holdest mee straite behinde and before, and layest thine hand vpon me.
\v 6 Thy knowledge is too wonderfull for mee: it is so high that I cannot attaine vnto it.
\v 7 Whither shall I goe from thy Spirite? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
\v 8 If I ascende into heauen, thou art there: if I lye downe in hell, thou art there.
\v 9 Let mee take the winges of the morning, and dwell in the vttermost parts of the sea:
\v 10 Yet thither shall thine hand leade me, and thy right hand holde me.
\v 11 If I say, Yet the darkenes shall hide me, euen the night shalbe light about me.
\v 12 Yea, the darkenes hideth not from thee: but the night shineth as the day: the darkenes and light are both alike.
\v 13 For thou hast possessed my reines: thou hast couered me in my mothers wombe.
\v 14 I will praise thee, for I am fearefully and wonderously made: marueilous are thy workes, and my soule knoweth it well.
\v 15 My bones are not hid from thee, though I was made in a secret place, and facioned beneath in the earth.
\v 16 Thine eyes did see me, when I was without forme: for in thy booke were all things written, which in continuance were facioned, when there was none of them before.
\v 17 Howe deare therefore are thy thoughtes vnto me, O God! how great is ye summe of them!
\v 18 If I should count them, they are moe then the sand: when I wake, I am still with thee.
\v 19 Oh that thou wouldest slay, O God, the wicked and bloody men, to whom I say, Depart ye from mee:
\v 20 Which speake wickedly of thee, and being thine enemies are lifted vp in vaine.
\v 21 Doe not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and doe not I earnestly contend with those that rise vp against thee?
\v 22 I hate them with an vnfained hatred, as they were mine vtter enemies.
\v 23 Try mee, O God, and knowe mine heart: prooue me and know my thoughtes,
\v 24 And consider if there be any way of wickednes in me, and leade me in the way for euer.
