\v 1 To him that excelleth upon Shushan Eduth, or Michtam. A Psalme of David to teach. When he fought against Aram Naharaim, and against Aram Zobah, when Joab returned and slew twelve thousand Edomites in the salt valley. O God, thou hast cast vs out, thou hast scattered vs, thou hast bene angry, turne againe vnto vs.
\v 2 Thou hast made the land to tremble, and hast made it to gape: heale the breaches thereof, for it is shaken.
\v 3 Thou hast shewed thy people heauy things: thou hast made vs to drinke the wine of giddines.
\v 4 But now thou hast giuen a banner to them that feare thee, that it may be displayed because of thy trueth. Selah.
\v 5 That thy beloued may be deliuered, helpe with thy right hand and heare me.
\v 6 God hath spoken in his holines: therefore I will reioyce: I shall deuide Shechem, and measure the valley of Succoth.
\v 7 Gilead shalbe mine, and Manasseh shalbe mine: Ephraim also shalbe the strength of mine head: Iudah is my lawgiuer.
\v 8 Moab shalbe my wash pot: ouer Edom will I cast out my shoe: Palestina shew thy selfe ioyfull for me.
\v 9 Who will leade me into the strong citie? who will bring me vnto Edom?
\v 10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadest cast vs off, and didest not go forth, O God, with our armies?
\v 11 Giue vs helpe against trouble: for vaine is the helpe of man.
\v 12 Through God we shall doe valiantly: for he shall tread downe our enemies.
