\c 88

\v 1 A song or Psalme of Heman the Ezrahite to give instruction, committed to the sonnes of Korah for him that excelleth upon Malath Leannoth. O Lord God of my saluation, I cry day and night before thee.
\v 2 Let my prayer enter into thy presence: incline thine eare vnto my cry.
\v 3 For my soule is filled with euils, and my life draweth neere to the graue.
\v 4 I am counted among them that go downe vnto the pit, and am as a man without strength:
\v 5 Free among the dead, like the slaine lying in the graue, whome thou remembrest no more, and they are cut off from thine hand.
\v 6 Thou hast layde me in the lowest pit, in darkenes, and in the deepe.
\v 7 Thine indignation lyeth vpon me, and thou hast vexed me with all thy waues. Selah.
\v 8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance farre from me, and made mee to be abhorred of them: I am shut vp, and cannot get foorth.
\v 9 Mine eye is sorowfull through mine affliction: Lord, I call dayly vpon thee: I stretch out mine hands vnto thee.
\v 10 Wilt thou shewe a miracle to the dead? or shall the dead rise and prayse thee? Selah.
\v 11 Shall thy louing kindenes be declared in the graue? or thy faithfulnes in destruction?
\v 12 Shall thy wonderous workes be knowen in the darke? and thy righteousnes in the land of obliuion?
\v 13 But vnto thee haue I cryed, O Lord, and early shall my prayer come before thee.
\v 14 Lord, why doest thou reiect my soule, and hidest thy face from me?
\v 15 I am afflicted and at the point of death: from my youth I suffer thy terrours, doubting of my life.
\v 16 Thine indignations goe ouer me, and thy feare hath cut me off.
\v 17 They came round about me dayly like water, and compassed me together.
\v 18 My louers and friends hast thou put away from me, and mine acquaintance hid themselues.
