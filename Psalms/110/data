\c 110
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. The Lord said vnto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, vntill I make thine enemies thy footestoole.
\v 2 The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Zion: be thou ruler in the middes of thine enemies.
\v 3 Thy people shall come willingly at the time of assembling thine armie in holy beautie: the youth of thy wombe shalbe as the morning dewe.
\v 4 The Lord sware and wil not repent, Thou art a Priest for euer after ye order of Melchi-zedek.
\v 5 The Lord, that is at thy right hand, shall wound Kings in the day of his wrath.
\v 6 He shalbe iudge among the heathen: he shall fill all with dead bodies, and smite the head ouer great countreis.
\v 7 He shall drinke of the brooke in the way: therefore shall he lift vp his head.
