\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The heauens declare the glory of God, and the firmament sheweth ye worke of his hands.
\v 2 Day vnto day vttereth the same, and night vnto night teacheth knowledge.
\v 3 There is no speach nor language, where their voyce is not heard.
\v 4 Their line is gone forth through all the earth, and their words into the endes of the world: in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sunne.
\v 5 Which commeth forth as a bridegrome out of his chamber, and reioyceth like a mightie man to runne his race.
\v 6 His going out is from the ende of the heauen, and his compasse is vnto the endes of ye same, and none is hid from the heate thereof.
\v 7 The Lawe of the Lord is perfite, conuerting the soule: the testimonie of the Lord is sure, and giueth wisedome vnto the simple.
\v 8 The statutes of the Lord are right and reioyce the heart: the commandement of the Lord is pure, and giueth light vnto the eyes.
\v 9 The feare of the Lord is cleane, and indureth for euer: the iudgements of the Lord are trueth: they are righteous altogether,
\v 10 And more to be desired then golde, yea, then much fine golde: sweeter also then honie and the honie combe.
\v 11 Moreouer by them is thy seruant made circumspect, and in keeping of them there is great reward.
\v 12 Who can vnderstand his faultes? clense me from secret fautes.
\v 13 Keepe thy seruant also from presumptuous sinnes: let them not reigne ouer me: so shall I be vpright, and made cleane from much wickednes.
\v 14 Let the wordes of my mouth, and the meditation of mine heart be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.
