\c 108

\v 1 A song or Psalme of David. O God, mine heart is prepared, so is my tongue: I will sing and giue praise.
\v 2 Awake viole and harpe: I will awake early.
\v 3 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people, and I wil sing vnto thee among the nations.
\v 4 For thy mercy is great aboue the heauens, and thy trueth vnto the clouds.
\v 5 Exalt thy self, O God, aboue the heauens, and let thy glorie be vpon all the earth,
\v 6 That thy beloued may be deliuered: helpe with thy right hand and heare me.
\v 7 God hath spoken in his holinesse: therefore I will reioyce, I shall deuide Shechem and measure the valley of Succoth.
\v 8 Gilead shalbe mine, and Manasseh shalbe mine: Ephraim also shalbe the strength of mine head: Iuda is my lawgiuer.
\v 9 Moab shalbe my washpot: ouer Edom wil I cast out my shoe: vpon Palestina wil I triumph.
\v 10 Who will leade mee into the strong citie? who will bring me vnto Edom?
\v 11 Wilt not thou, O God, which haddest forsaken vs, and diddest not goe foorth, O God, with our armies?
\v 12 Giue vs helpe against trouble: for vaine is the helpe of man.
\v 13 Through God we shall doe valiantly: for he shall treade downe our enemies.
