\c 12
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth upon the eight tune. A Psalme of Dauid. Helpe Lord, for there is not a godly man left: for the faithfull are fayled from among the children of men.
\v 2 They speake deceitfully euery one with his neighbour, flattering with their lips, and speake with a double heart.
\v 3 The Lord cut off all flattering lippes, and the tongue that speaketh proude things:
\v 4 Which haue saide, With our tongue will we preuaile: our lippes are our owne: who is Lord ouer vs?
\v 5 Now for the oppression of the needy, and for the sighes of the poore, I will vp, sayeth the Lord, and will set at libertie him, whom the wicked hath snared.
\v 6 The wordes of the Lord are pure wordes, as the siluer, tried in a fornace of earth, fined seuen folde.
\v 7 Thou wilt keepe them, O Lord: thou wilt preserue him from this generation for euer.
\v 8 The wicked walke on euery side: when they are exalted, it is a shame for the sonnes of men.
