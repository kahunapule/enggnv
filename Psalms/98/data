\v 1 A Psalme. Sing vnto the Lord a newe song: for hee hath done marueilous things: his right hand, and his holy arme haue gotten him the victorie.
\v 2 The Lord declared his saluation: his righteousnes hath he reueiled in the sight of ye nations.
\v 3 He hath remembred his mercy and his trueth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth haue seene the saluation of our God.
\v 4 All the earth, sing ye loude vnto the Lord: crie out and reioyce, and sing prayses.
\v 5 Sing prayse to the Lord vpon the harpe, euen vpon the harpe with a singing voyce.
\v 6 With shalmes and sound of trumpets sing loude before the Lord the King.
\v 7 Let the sea roare, and all that therein is, the world, and they that dwell therein.
\v 8 Let the floods clap their hands, and let the mountaines reioyce together
\v 9 Before the Lord: for he is come to iudge the earth: with righteousnesse shall hee iudge the world, and the people with equitie.
