\c 27

\v 1 A Psalme of David. The Lord is my light and my saluation, whom shall I feare? the Lord is the strength of my life, of whome shall I be afraide?
\v 2 When the wicked, euen mine enemies and my foes came vpon mee to eate vp my flesh; they stumbled and fell.
\v 3 Though an hoste pitched against me, mine heart should not be afraide: though warre be raised against me, I will trust in this.
\v 4 One thing haue I desired of the Lord, that I will require, euen that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the dayes of my life, to beholde the beautie of the Lord, and to visite his Temple.
\v 5 For in the time of trouble hee shall hide mee in his Tabernacle: in the secrete place of his pauillion shall he hide me, and set me vp vpon a rocke.
\v 6 And nowe shall hee lift vp mine head aboue mine enemies rounde about mee: therefore wil I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of ioy: I wil sing and praise the Lord.
\v 7 Hearken vnto my voyce, O Lord, when I crie: haue mercie also vpon mee and heare mee.
\v 8 When thou saidest, Seeke ye my face, mine heart answered vnto thee, O Lord, I will seeke thy face.
\v 9 Hide not therefore thy face from mee, nor cast thy seruat away in displeasure: thou hast bene my succour: leaue me not, neither forsake mee, O God of my saluation.
\v 10 Though my father and my mother shoulde forsake me, yet the Lord will gather me vp.
\v 11 Teache mee thy way, O Lord, and leade me in a right path, because of mine enemies.
\v 12 Giue me not vnto the lust of mine aduersaries: for there are false witnesses risen vp against me, and such as speake cruelly.
\v 13 I should haue fainted, except I had beleeued to see the goodnes of the Lord in the land of the liuing.
\v 14 Hope in the Lord: be strong, and he shall comfort thine heart, and trust in the Lord.
