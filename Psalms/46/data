\v 1 To him that excelleth upon Alamoth a song committed to the sonnes of Korah. God is our hope and strength, and helpe in troubles, ready to be found.
\v 2 Therefore will not we feare, though the earth be moued, and though the mountaines fall into the middes of the sea.
\v 3 Though the waters thereof rage and be troubled, and the mountaines shake at the surges of the same. Selah,
\v 4 Yet there is a Riuer, whose streames shall make glad the citie of God: euen the Sanctuarie of the Tabernacles of the most High.
\v 5 God is in the middes of it: therefore shall it not be moued: God shall helpe it very earely.
\v 6 When the nations raged, and the kingdomes were moued, God thundred, and the earth melted.
\v 7 The Lord of hostes is with vs: the God of Iaakob is our refuge. Selah.
\v 8 Come, and behold the workes of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
\v 9 He maketh warres to cease vnto the endes of the world: he breaketh the bowe and cutteth the speare, and burneth the chariots with fire.
\v 10 Be still and knowe that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, and I wil be exalted in the earth.
\v 11 The Lord of hostes is with vs: the God of Iaakob is our refuge. Selah.
