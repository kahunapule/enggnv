\c 20

\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. The Lord heare thee in the day of trouble: the name of ye God of Iaakob defend thee:
\v 2 Send thee helpe from the Sanctuarie, and strengthen thee out of Zion.
\v 3 Let him remember all thine offerings, and turne thy burnt offerings into asshes. Selah:
\v 4 And graunt thee according to thine heart, and fulfill all thy purpose:
\v 5 That we may reioyce in thy saluation, and set vp the banner in the Name of our God, when the Lord shall performe all thy petitions.
\v 6 Now know I that the Lord will helpe his anointed, and will heare him from his Sanctuarie, by the mightie helpe of his right hand.
\v 7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the Name of ye Lord our God.
\v 8 They are brought downe and fallen, but we are risen, and stand vpright.
\v 9 Saue Lord: let the King heare vs in the day that we call.
