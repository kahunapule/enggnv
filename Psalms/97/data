\v 1 The Lord reigneth: let the earth reioyce: let the multitude of the yles be glad.
\v 2 Cloudes and darkenes are round about him: righteousnesse and iudgement are the foundation of his throne.
\v 3 There shall goe a fire before him, and burne vp his enemies round about.
\v 4 His lightnings gaue light vnto the worlde: the earth sawe it and was afraide.
\v 5 The mountaines melted like waxe at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
\v 6 The heauens declare his righteousnes, and all the people see his glory.
\v 7 Confounded be all they that serue grauen images, and that glory in idoles: worship him all ye gods.
\v 8 Zion heard of it, and was glad: and the daughters of Iudah reioyced, because of thy iudgements, O Lord.
\v 9 For thou, Lord, art most High aboue all the earth: thou art much exalted aboue all gods.
\v 10 Ye that loue the Lord, hate euill: he preserueth the soules of his Saints: hee will deliuer them from the hand of the wicked.
\v 11 Light is sowen for the righteous, and ioy for the vpright in heart.
\v 12 Reioyce ye righteous in the Lord, and giue thankes for his holy remembrance.
