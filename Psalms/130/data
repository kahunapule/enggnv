\c 130
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. Out of the deepe places haue I called vnto thee, O Lord.
\v 2 Lord, heare my voyce: let thine eares attend to the voyce of my prayers.
\v 3 If thou, O Lord, straightly markest iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
\v 4 But mercie is with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
\v 5 I haue waited on the Lord: my soule hath waited, and I haue trusted in his worde.
\v 6 My soule waiteth on the Lord more then the morning watch watcheth for the morning.
\v 7 Let Israel waite on the Lord: for with the Lord is mercie, and with him is great redemption.
\v 8 And he shall redeeme Israel from all his iniquities.
