\v 1 To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme of Dauid. Heare me when I call, O God of my righteousnes: thou hast set me at libertie, when I was in distresse: haue mercie vpon me and hearken vnto my prayer.
\v 2 O ye sonnes of men, howe long will yee turne my glory into shame, louing vanitie, and seeking lyes? Selah.
\v 3 For be ye sure that the Lord hath chosen to himselfe a godly man: the Lord will heare when I call vnto him.
\v 4 Tremble, and sinne not: examine your owne heart vpon your bed, and be still. Selah.
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousnes, and trust in the Lord.
\v 6 Many say, Who will shewe vs any good? but Lord, lift vp the light of thy countenance vpon vs.
\v 7 Thou hast giuen mee more ioye of heart, then they haue had, when their wheate and their wine did abound.
\v 8 I will lay mee downe, and also sleepe in peace: for thou, Lord, onely makest me dwell in safetie.
