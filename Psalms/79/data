\c 79

\v 1 A Psalme committed to Asaph. O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance: thine holy Temple haue they defiled, and made Ierusalem heapes of stones.
\v 2 The dead bodies of thy seruats haue they giuen to be meat vnto foules of ye heauen: and the flesh of thy Saintes vnto the beastes of the earth.
\v 3 Their blood haue they shead like waters rounde about Ierusalem, and there was none to burie them.
\v 4 Wee are a reproche to our neighbours, euen a scorne and derision vnto them that are round about vs.
\v 5 Lord, howe long wilt thou be angrie, for euer? shall thy gelousie burne like fire?
\v 6 Powre out thy wrath vpon the heathen that haue not knowen thee, and vpon the kingdomes that haue not called vpon thy Name.
\v 7 For they haue deuoured Iaakob and made his dwelling place desolate.
\v 8 Remember not against vs the former iniquities, but make haste and let thy tender mercies preuent vs: for we are in great miserie.
\v 9 Helpe vs, O God of our saluation, for the glorie of thy Name, and deliuer vs, and be mercifull vnto our sinnes for thy Names sake.
\v 10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be knowen among the heathen in our sight by the vengeance of the blood of thy seruants that is shed.
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoners come before thee: according to thy mightie arme preserue the children of death,
\v 12 And render to our neighbours seuen folde into their bosome their reproche, wherewith they haue reproched thee, O Lord.
\v 13 So wee thy people, and sheepe of thy pasture shall praise thee for euer: and from generation to generation we will set foorth thy praise.
