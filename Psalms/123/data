\c 123

\v 1 A song of degrees. I lift vp mine eyes to thee, that dwellest in the heauens.
\v 2 Behold, as the eyes of seruants looke vnto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a mayden vnto the hand of her mistres: so our eyes waite vpon the Lord our God vntil he haue mercie vpon vs.
\v 3 Haue mercie vpon vs, O Lord, haue mercie vpon vs: for we haue suffered too much contempt.
\v 4 Our soule is filled too full of ye mocking of the wealthy, and of the despitefulnes of the proude.
