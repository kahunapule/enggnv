\c 138
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. I will praise thee with my whole heart: euen before the gods will I praise thee.
\v 2 I will worship toward thine holy Temple and praise thy Name, because of thy louing kindenesse and for thy trueth: for thou hast magnified thy Name aboue all things by thy word.
\v 3 When I called, then thou heardest me, and hast encreased strength in my soule.
\v 4 All the Kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they haue heard the wordes of thy mouth.
\v 5 And they shall sing of the wayes of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord is great.
\v 6 For the Lord is high: yet he beholdeth the lowly, but the proude he knoweth afarre off.
\v 7 Though I walke in the middes of trouble, yet wilt thou reuiue me: thou wilt stretch foorth thine hand vpon the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall saue me.
\v 8 The Lord will performe his worke toward me: O Lord, thy mercie endureth for euer: forsake not the workes of thine handes.
