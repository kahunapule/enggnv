\c 121
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. I will lift mine eyes vnto the mountaines, from whence mine helpe shall come.
\v 2 Mine helpe commeth from the Lord, which hath made the heauen and the earth.
\v 3 He wil not suffer thy foote to slippe: for he that keepeth thee, will not slumber.
\v 4 Beholde, he that keepeth Israel, wil neither slumber nor sleepe.
\v 5 The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shadow at thy right hand.
\v 6 The sunne shall not smite thee by day, nor the moone by night.
\v 7 The Lord shall preserue thee from all euil: he shall keepe thy soule.
\v 8 The Lord shall preserue thy going out, and thy comming in from henceforth and for euer.
