\c 75

\v 1 To him that excelleth. Destroy not. A Psalme or song committed toAsaph. We will prayse thee, O God, we will prayse thee, for thy Name is neere: therefore they will declare thy wonderous workes.
\v 2 When I shall take a conuenient time, I will iudge righteously.
\v 3 The earth and all the inhabitantes thereof are dissolued: but I will establish the pillars of it. Selah.
\v 4 I saide vnto the foolish, Be not so foolish, and to the wicked, Lift not vp the horne.
\v 5 Lift not vp your horne on high, neither speake with a stiffe necke.
\v 6 For to come to preferment is neither from the East, nor from the West, nor from the South,
\v 7 But God is the iudge: he maketh lowe and he maketh hie.
\v 8 For in the hand of the Lord is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixt, and he powreth out of the same: surely all the wicked of the earth shall wring out and drinke the dregges thereof.
\v 9 But I will declare for euer, and sing prayses vnto the God of Iaakob.
\v 10 All the hornes of the wicked also will I breake: but the hornes of the righteous shalbe exalted.
