\c 1

\v 1 Blessed is the man that doeth not walke in the counsell of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in ye seate of the scornefull:
\v 2 But his delite is in the Lawe of the Lord, and in his Lawe doeth he meditate day and night.
\v 3 For he shall be like a tree planted by the riuers of waters, that will bring foorth her fruite in due season: whose leafe shall not fade: so whatsoeuer he shall doe, shall prosper.
\v 4 The wicked are not so, but as the chaffe, which the winde driueth away.
\v 5 Therefore the wicked shall not stande in the iudgement, nor sinners in the assemblie of the righteous.
\v 6 For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish.
