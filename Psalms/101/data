\c 101
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. I will sing mercie and iudgement: vnto thee, O Lord, will I sing.
\v 2 I will doe wisely in the perfite way, till thou commest to me: I will walke in the vprightnes of mine heart in the middes of mine house.
\v 3 I wil set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the worke of them that fall away: it shall not cleaue vnto me.
\v 4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will knowe none euill.
\v 5 Him that priuily slandereth his neighbour, wil I destroy: him that hath a proude looke and hie heart, I cannot suffer.
\v 6 Mine eyes shalbe vnto the faithfull of the lande, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfite way, he shall serue me.
\v 7 There shall no deceitful person dwell within mine house: he that telleth lyes, shall not remaine in my sight.
\v 8 Betimes will I destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all the workers of iniquitie from the Citie of the Lord.
