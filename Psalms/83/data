\c 83

\v 1 A song, or Psalme committed to Asaph. Keep not thou silence, O God: bee not still, and cease not, O God.
\v 2 For lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee, haue lifted vp the head.
\v 3 They haue taken craftie counsell against thy people, and haue consulted against thy secret ones.
\v 4 They haue said, Come and let vs cut them off from being a nation: and let the name of Israel be no more in remembrance.
\v 5 For they haue consulted together in heart, and haue made a league against thee:
\v 6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Agarims:
\v 7 Gebal and Ammon, and Amalech, the Philistims with the inhabitants of Tyrus:
\v 8 Asshur also is ioyned with them: they haue bene an arme to the children of Lot. Selah.
\v 9 Doe thou to them as vnto the Midianites: as to Sisera and as to Iabin at the riuer of Kishon.
\v 10 They perished at En-dor, and were dung for the earth.
\v 11 Make them, euen their princes like Oreb and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes like Zebah and like Zalmuna.
\v 12 Which haue said, Let vs take for our possession the habitations of God.
\v 13 O my God, make them like vnto a wheele, and as the stubble before the winde.
\v 14 As the fire burneth the forest, and as the flame setteth the mountaines on fire:
\v 15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraide with thy storme.
\v 16 Fill their faces with shame, that they may seeke thy Name, O Lord.
\v 17 Let them be confounded and troubled for euer: yea, let them be put to shame and perish,
\v 18 That they may knowe that thou, which art called Iehouah, art alone, euen the most High ouer all the earth.
