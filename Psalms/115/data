\c 115

\v 1 Not vnto vs, O Lord, not vnto vs, but vnto thy Name giue the glorie, for thy louing mercie and for thy truethes sake.
\v 2 Wherefore shall the heathen say, Where is nowe their God?
\v 3 But our God is in heauen: he doeth what so euer he will.
\v 4 Their idoles are siluer and golde, euen the worke of mens hands.
\v 5 They haue a mouth and speake not: they haue eyes and see not.
\v 6 They haue eares and heare not: they haue noses and smelll not.
\v 7 They haue handes and touche not: they haue feete and walke not: neither make they a sound with their throte.
\v 8 They that make them are like vnto them: so are all that trust in them.
\v 9 O Israel, trust thou in the Lord: for he is their helpe and their shielde.
\v 10 O house of Aaron, trust ye in the Lord: for he is their helpe and their shielde.
\v 11 Ye that feare the Lord, trust in the Lord: for he is their helper and their shield.
\v 12 The Lord hath bene mindfull of vs: he will blesse, he will blesse the house of Israel, he will blesse the house of Aaron.
\v 13 He will blesse them that feare the Lord, both small and great.
\v 14 The Lord will increase his graces towarde you, euen toward you and toward your children.
\v 15 Ye are blessed of the Lord, which made the heauen and the earth.
\v 16 The heauens, euen the heauens are the Lordes: but he hath giuen the earth to the sonnes of men.
\v 17 The dead prayse not the Lord, neither any that goe downe into the place of silence.
\v 18 But we will prayse the Lord from henceforth and for euer. Prayse ye the Lord.
