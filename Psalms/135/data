\c 135
\p
\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise the Name of the Lord: ye seruants of the Lord, praise him.
\v 2 Ye that stande in the House of the Lord, and in the courtes of the House of our God,
\v 3 Praise ye the Lord: for the Lord is good: sing praises vnto his Name: for it is a comely thing.
\v 4 For the Lord hath chosen Iaakob to himselfe, and Israel for his chiefe treasure.
\v 5 For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is aboue all gods.
\v 6 Whatsoeuer pleased the Lord, that did hee in heauen and in earth, in the sea, and in all the depths.
\v 7 He bringeth vp the cloudes from the ends of the earth, and maketh the lightnings with ye raine: he draweth foorth the winde out of his treasures.
\v 8 He smote the first borne of Egypt both of man and beast.
\v 9 He hath sent tokens and wonders into the middes of thee, O Egypt, vpon Pharaoh, and vpon all his seruants.
\v 10 He smote many nations, and slew mightie Kings:
\v 11 As Sihon King of the Amorites, and Og King of Bashan, and all the kingdomes of Canaan:
\v 12 And gaue their lande for an inheritance, euen an inheritance vnto Israel his people.
\v 13 Thy Name, O Lord, endureth for euer: O Lord, thy remembrance is from generation to generation.
\v 14 For the Lord will iudge his people, and be pacified towardes his seruants.
\v 15 The idoles of the heathen are siluer and golde, euen the worke of mens handes.
\v 16 They haue a mouth, and speake not: they haue eyes and see not.
\v 17 They haue eares and heare not, neither is there any breath in their mouth.
\v 18 They that make them, are like vnto them: so are all that trust in them.
\v 19 Praise the Lord, ye house of Israel: praise the Lord, ye house of Aaron.
\v 20 Praise the Lord, ye house of Leui: ye that feare the Lord, praise the Lord.
\v 21 Praised bee the Lord out of Zion, which dwelleth in Ierusalem. Praise ye the Lord.
