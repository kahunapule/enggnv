\c 13
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of Dauid. Howe long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, for euer? howe long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
\v 2 How long shall I take counsell within my selfe, hauing wearinesse dayly in mine heart? how long shall mine enemie be exalted aboue me?
\v 3 Beholde, and heare mee, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleepe not in death:
\v 4 Lest mine enemie say, I haue preuailed against him: and they that afflict me, reioyce when I slide.
\v 5 But I trust in thy mercie: mine heart shall reioyce in thy saluation: I will sing to the Lord, because he hath delt louingly with me.
