\c 6

\v 1 To him that excelleth on Neginoth upon the eith tune. A Psalme of Dauid. O lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy wrath.
\v 2 Haue mercie vpon me, O Lord, for I am weake: O Lord heale me, for my bones are vexed.
\v 3 My soule is also sore troubled: but Lord how long wilt thou delay?
\v 4 Returne, O Lord: deliuer my soule: saue me for thy mercies sake.
\v 5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the graue who shall prayse thee?
\v 6 I fainted in my mourning: I cause my bed euery night to swimme, and water my couch with my teares.
\v 7 Mine eye is dimmed for despight, and sunke in because of all mine enemies.
\v 8 Away from mee all ye workers of iniquitie: for the Lord hath heard the voyce of my weeping.
\v 9 The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receiue my prayer.
\v 10 All mine enemies shall be confounded and sore vexed: they shall be turned backe, and put to shame suddenly.
