\v 1 To him that excelleth. A Psalme of David. Deliuer me, O Lord, from the euill man: preserue me from the cruel man:
\v 2 Which imagine euill things in their heart, and make warre continually.
\v 3 They haue sharpened their tongues like a serpent: adders poyson is vnder their lips. Selah.
\v 4 Keepe mee, O Lord, from the handes of the wicked: preserue mee from the cruell man, which purposeth to cause my steppes to slide.
\v 5 The proude haue layde a snare for me, and spred a nette with cordes in my pathway, and set grennes for me. Selah.
\v 6 Therefore I saide vnto the Lord, Thou art my God: heare, O Lord, the voyce of my prayers.
\v 7 O Lord God the strength of my saluation, thou hast couered mine head in the day of battel.
\v 8 Let not the wicked haue his desire, O Lord: performe not his wicked thought, least they be proude. Selah.
\v 9 As for the chiefe of them, that compasse me about, let the mischiefe of their owne lippes come vpon them.
\v 10 Let coles fal vpon them: let him cast them into the fire, and into the deepe pits, that they rise not.
\v 11 For the backbiter shall not be established vpon the earth: euill shall hunt the cruell man to destruction.
\v 12 I know that the Lord will auenge the afflicted, and iudge the poore.
\v 13 Surely the righteous shall prayse thy Name, and the iust shall dwell in thy presence.
