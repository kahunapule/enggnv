\c 122
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees, or Psalme of David. I rejoiced, when they sayd to me, We wil go into the house of the Lord.
\v 2 Our feete shall stand in thy gates, O Ierusalem.
\v 3 Ierusalem is builded as a citie, that is compact together in it selfe:
\v 4 Whereunto the Tribes, euen the Tribes of the Lord go vp according to the testimonie to Israel, to prayse the Name of the Lord.
\v 5 For there are thrones set for iudgement, euen the thrones of the house of Dauid.
\v 6 Pray for the peace of Ierusalem: let them prosper that loue thee.
\v 7 Peace be within thy walles, and prosperitie within thy palaces.
\v 8 For my brethren and neighbours sakes I will wish thee now prosperitie.
\v 9 Because of the House of the Lord our God, I will procure thy wealth.
