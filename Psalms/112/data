\c 112
\p
\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. Blessed is the man, that feareth the Lord, and deliteth greatly in his commandements.
\v 2 His seede shall be mightie vpon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed.
\v 3 Riches and treasures shalbe in his house, and his righteousnesse endureth for euer.
\v 4 Vnto the righteous ariseth light in darkenes: he is merciful and full of copassion and righteous.
\v 5 A good man is mercifull and lendeth, and will measure his affaires by iudgement.
\v 6 Surely he shall neuer be moued: but the righteous shalbe had in euerlasting remembrance.
\v 7 He will not be afraide of euill tidings: for his heart is fixed, and beleeueth in the Lord.
\v 8 His heart is stablished: therefore he will not feare, vntill he see his desire vpon his enemies.
\v 9 He hath distributed and giuen to ye poore: his righteousnesse remaineth for euer: his horne shalbe exalted with glory.
\v 10 The wicked shall see it and be angrie: he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
