\c 143
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and hearken vnto my supplication: answere me in thy trueth and in thy righteousnes.
\v 2 (And enter not into iudgement with thy seruant: for in thy sight shall none that liueth, be iustified)
\v 3 For the enemie hath persecuted my soule: he hath smitten my life downe to the earth: he hath layde me in the darkenes, as they that haue bene dead long agoe:
\v 4 And my spirit was in perplexitie in me, and mine heart within me was amased.
\v 5 Yet doe I remember the time past: I meditate in all thy workes, yea, I doe meditate in the workes of thine hands.
\v 6 I stretch forth mine hands vnto thee: my soule desireth after thee, as the thirstie land. Selah.
\v 7 Heare me speedily, O Lord, for my spirit fayleth: hide not thy face from me, els I shall be like vnto them that go downe into the pit.
\v 8 Let me heare thy louing kindenes in the morning, for in thee is my trust: shewe mee the way, that I should walke in, for I lift vp my soule vnto thee.
\v 9 Deliuer me, O Lord, from mine enemies: for I hid me with thee.
\v 10 Teach me to doe thy will, for thou art my God: let thy good Spirit leade me vnto the land of righteousnes.
\v 11 Quicken me, O Lord, for thy Names sake, and for thy righteousnesse bring my soule out of trouble.
\v 12 And for thy mercy slay mine enemies, and destroy all them that oppresse my soule: for I am thy seruant.
