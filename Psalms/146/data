\c 146
\p
\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise thou the Lord, O my soule.
\v 2 I will prayse the Lord during my life: as long as I haue any being, I wil sing vnto my God.
\v 3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the sonne of man, for there is none helpe in him.
\v 4 His breath departeth, and he returneth to his earth: then his thoughtes perish.
\v 5 Blessed is he, that hath the God of Iaakob for his helpe, whose hope is in the Lord his God.
\v 6 Which made heauen and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth his fidelitie for euer:
\v 7 Which executeth iustice for the oppressed: which giueth bread to the hungry: the Lord loseth the prisoners.
\v 8 The Lord giueth sight to the blinde: the Lord rayseth vp the crooked: the Lord loueth the righteous.
\v 9 The Lord keepeth the strangers: he relieueth the fatherlesse and widowe: but he ouerthroweth the way of the wicked.
\v 10 The Lord shall reigne for euer: O Zion, thy God endureth from generation to generation. Prayse ye the Lord.
