\v 1 To him that excelleth on Gittith. A Psalme of Dauid. O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the worlde! which hast set thy glory aboue the heauens.
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babes and suckelings hast thou ordeined strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemie and the auenger.
\v 3 When I beholde thine heauens, euen the workes of thy fingers, the moone and the starres which thou hast ordeined,
\v 4 What is man, say I, that thou art mindefull of him? and the sonne of man, that thou visitest him?
\v 5 For thou hast made him a little lower then God, and crowned him with glory and worship.
\v 6 Thou hast made him to haue dominion in the workes of thine hands: thou hast put all things vnder his feete:
\v 7 All sheepe and oxen: yea, and the beastes of the fielde:
\v 8 The foules of the ayre, and the fish of the sea, and that which passeth through the paths of the seas.
\v 9 O Lord our Lord, howe excellent is thy Name in all the world!
