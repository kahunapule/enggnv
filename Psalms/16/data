\c 16

\v 1 Michtam of Dauid. Preserue mee, O God: for in thee doe I trust.
\v 2 O my soule, thou hast sayd vnto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my weldoing extendeth not to thee,
\v 3 But to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent: all my delite is in them.
\v 4 The sorowes of them, that offer to an other god, shall be multiplied: their offerings of blood will I not offer, neither make mention of their names with my lips.
\v 5 The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou shalt mainteine my lot.
\v 6 The lines are fallen vnto me in pleasant places: yea, I haue a faire heritage.
\v 7 I wil prayse the Lord, who hath giuen me counsell: my reines also teach me in the nightes.
\v 8 I haue set the Lord alwayes before me: for hee is at my right hand: therefore I shall not slide.
\v 9 Wherefore mine heart is glad and my tongue reioyceth: my flesh also doeth rest in hope.
\v 10 For thou wilt not leaue my soule in the graue: neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption.
\v 11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is the fulnesse of ioy: and at thy right hand there are pleasures for euermore.
