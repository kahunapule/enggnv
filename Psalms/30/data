\c 30

\v 1 A Psalme or song of the dedication of the house of David. I will magnifie thee, O Lord: for thou hast exalted mee, and hast not made my foe to reioyce ouer me.
\v 2 O Lord my God, I cried vnto thee, and thou hast restored me.
\v 3 O Lord, thou hast brought vp my soule out of the graue: thou hast reuiued me from them that goe downe into the pit.
\v 4 Sing praises vnto the Lord, ye his Saintes, and giue thankes before the remembrance of his Holinesse.
\v 5 For he endureth but a while in his anger: but in his fauour is life: weeping may abide at euening, but ioy commeth in the morning.
\v 6 And in my prosperitie I sayde, I shall neuer be moued.
\v 7 For thou Lord of thy goodnes hadest made my mountaine to stande strong: but thou didest hide thy face, and I was troubled.
\v 8 Then cried I vnto thee, O Lord, and praied to my Lord.
\v 9 What profite is there in my blood, when I go downe to the pit? shall the dust giue thankes vnto thee? or shall it declare thy trueth?
\v 10 Heare, O Lord, and haue mercy vpon me: Lord, be thou mine helper.
\v 11 Thou hast turned my mourning into ioy: thou hast loosed my sacke and girded mee with gladnesse.
\v 12 Therefore shall my tongue praise thee and not cease: O Lord my God, I will giue thankes vnto thee for euer.
