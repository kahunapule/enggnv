\c 76
\p
\v 1 To him that excelleth on Neginoth. A Psalme or song committed to Asaph. God is knowen in Iudah: his Name is great in Israel.
\v 2 For in Shalem is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Zion.
\v 3 There brake he the arrowes of the bowe, the shielde and the sword and the battell. Selah.
\v 4 Thou art more bright and puissant, then the mountaines of pray.
\v 5 The stout hearted are spoyled: they haue slept their sleepe, and all the men of strength haue not found their hands.
\v 6 At thy rebuke, O God of Iaakob, both the chariot and horse are cast a sleepe.
\v 7 Thou, euen thou art to be feared: and who shall stand in thy sight, when thou art angrie!
\v 8 Thou didest cause thy iudgement to bee heard from heauen: therefore the earth feared and was still,
\v 9 When thou, O God, arose to iudgement, to helpe all the meeke of the earth. Selah.
\v 10 Surely the rage of man shall turne to thy praise: the remnant of the rage shalt thou restrayne.
\v 11 Vowe and performe vnto the Lord your God, all ye that be rounde about him: let them bring presents vnto him that ought to be feared.
\v 12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the Kings of the earth.
