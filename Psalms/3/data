\v 1 A Psalme of Dauid, when he fled from his sonne Absalom. Lord, howe are mine aduersaries increased? howe many rise against me?
\v 2 Many say to my soule, There is no helpe for him in God. Selah.
\v 3 But thou Lord art a buckler for me: my glory, and the lifter vp of mine head.
\v 4 I did call vnto the Lord with my voyce, and he heard me out of his holy mountaine. Selah.
\v 5 I layed me downe and slept, and rose vp againe: for the Lord susteined me.
\v 6 I will not be afrayde for ten thousand of the people, that should beset me round about.
\v 7 O Lord, arise: helpe me, my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies vpon the cheeke bone: thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
\v 8 Saluation belongeth vnto the Lord, and thy blessing is vpon thy people. Selah.
