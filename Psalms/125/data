\c 125
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. They that trust in the Lord, shalbe as mount Zion, which can not be remooued, but remaineth for euer.
\v 2 As the mountaines are about Ierusalem: so is the Lord about his people from henceforth and for euer.
\v 3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous, least the righteous put forth their hand vnto wickednes.
\v 4 Doe well, O Lord, vnto those that be good and true in their hearts.
\v 5 But these that turne aside by their crooked wayes, them shall the Lord leade with the workers of iniquitie: but peace shalbe vpon Israel.
