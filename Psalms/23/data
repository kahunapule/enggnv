\c 23
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. The Lord is my shepheard, I shall not want.
\v 2 He maketh me to rest in greene pasture, and leadeth me by the still waters.
\v 3 He restoreth my soule, and leadeth me in the paths of righteousnesse for his Names sake.
\v 4 Yea, though I should walke through the valley of the shadowe of death, I will feare no euill: for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staffe, they comfort me.
\v 5 Thou doest prepare a table before me in the sight of mine aduersaries: thou doest anoynt mine head with oyle, and my cuppe runneth ouer.
\v 6 Doubtlesse kindnesse and mercie shall follow me all the dayes of my life, and I shall remaine a long season in the house of the Lord.
