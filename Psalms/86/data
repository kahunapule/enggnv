\v 1 A prayer of David. Incline thine eare, O Lord, and heare me: for I am poore and needy.
\v 2 Preserue thou my soule, for I am mercifull: my God, saue thou thy seruant, that trusteth in thee.
\v 3 Be mercifull vnto me, O Lord: for I crie vpon thee continually.
\v 4 Reioyce the soule of thy seruant: for vnto thee, O Lord, doe I lift vp my soule.
\v 5 For thou, Lord, art good and mercifull, and of great kindenes vnto all them, that call vpon thee.
\v 6 Giue eare, Lord, vnto my prayer, and hearken to the voyce of my supplication.
\v 7 In the day of my trouble I will call vpon thee: for thou hearest me.
\v 8 Among the gods there is none like thee, O Lord, and there is none that can doe like thy workes.
\v 9 All nations, whome thou hast made, shall come and worship before thee, O Lord, and shall glorifie thy Name.
\v 10 For thou art great and doest wonderous things: thou art God alone.
\v 11 Teach me thy way, O Lord, and I will walke in thy trueth: knit mine heart vnto thee, that I may feare thy Name.
\v 12 I wil prayse thee, O Lord my God, with all mine heart: yea, I wil glorifie thy Name for euer.
\v 13 For great is thy mercie toward me, and thou hast deliuered my soule from the lowest graue.
\v 14 O God, the proude are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men haue sought my soule, and haue not set thee before them.
\v 15 But thou, O Lord, art a pitifull God and mercifull, slowe to anger and great in kindenes and trueth.
\v 16 Turne vnto me, and haue mercy vpon me: giue thy strength vnto thy seruant, and saue the sonne of thine handmayd.
\v 17 Shew a token of thy goodnes towarde me, that they which hate me, may see it, and be ashamed, because thou, O Lord, hast holpen me and comforted me.
