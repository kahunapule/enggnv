\c 26
\p
\v 1 A Psalme of David. Judge me, O Lord, for I haue walked in mine innocency: my trust hath bene also in the Lord: therefore shall I not slide.
\v 2 Proue me, O Lord, and trie mee: examine my reines, and mine heart.
\v 3 For thy louing kindnesse is before mine eyes: therefore haue I walked in thy trueth.
\v 4 I haue not hanted with vaine persons, neither kept companie with the dissemblers.
\v 5 I haue hated the assemblie of the euill, and haue not companied with the wicked.
\v 6 I will wash mine handes in innocencie, O Lord, and compasse thine altar,
\v 7 That I may declare with the voyce of thankesgiuing, and set foorth all thy wonderous woorkes.
\v 8 O Lord, I haue loued the habitation of thine house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
\v 9 Gather not my soule with the sinners, nor my life with the bloodie men:
\v 10 In whose handes is wickednes, and their right hand is full of bribes.
\v 11 But I will walke in mine innocencie: redeeme me therefore, and be mercifull vnto me.
\v 12 My foote standeth in vprightnesse: I will praise thee, O Lord, in the Congregations.
