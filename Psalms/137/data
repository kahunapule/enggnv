\c 137

\v 1 By the riuers of Babel we sate, and there wee wept, when we remembred Zion.
\v 2 Wee hanged our harpes vpon the willowes in the middes thereof.
\v 3 Then they that ledde vs captiues, required of vs songs and mirth, when wee had hanged vp our harpes, saying, Sing vs one of the songs of Zion.
\v 4 Howe shall we sing, said we, a song of the Lord in a strange land?
\v 5 If I forget thee, O Ierusalem, let my right hand forget to play.
\v 6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth: yea, if I preferre not Ierusalem to my chiefe ioy.
\v 7 Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Ierusalem, which saide, Rase it, rase it to the foundation thereof.
\v 8 O daughter of Babel, worthy to be destroyed, blessed shall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast serued vs.
\v 9 Blessed shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy children against the stones.
