\c 127
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees, or Psalme of Salomon. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vaine that build it: except the Lord keepe the citie, the keeper watcheth in vaine.
\v 2 It is in vaine for you to rise earely, and to lie downe late, and eate the bread of sorow: but he wil surely giue rest to his beloued.
\v 3 Beholde, children are the inheritance of the Lord, and the fruite of the wombe his rewarde.
\v 4 As are the arrowes in the hand of ye strong man: so are the children of youth.
\v 5 Blessed is the man, that hath his quiuer full of them: for they shall not be ashamed, when they speake with their enemies in the gate.
