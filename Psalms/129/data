\c 129
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees. They haue often times afflicted me from my youth (may Israel nowe say)
\v 2 They haue often times afflicted me from my youth: but they could not preuaile against me.
\v 3 The plowers plowed vpon my backe, and made long furrowes.
\v 4 But the righteous Lord hath cut the cordes of the wicked.
\v 5 They that hate Zion, shalbe all ashamed and turned backward.
\v 6 They shalbe as the grasse on the house tops, which withereth afore it commeth forth.
\v 7 Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, neither the glainer his lap:
\v 8 Neither they, which go by, say, The blessing of the Lord be vpon you, or, We blesse you in the Name of the Lord.
