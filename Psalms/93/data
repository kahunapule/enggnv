\c 93
\p
\v 1 The Lord reigneth, and is clothed with maiestie: the Lord is clothed, and girded with power: the world also shall be established, that it cannot be mooued.
\v 2 Thy throne is established of olde: thou art from euerlasting.
\v 3 The floodes haue lifted vp, O Lord: the floodes haue lifted vp their voyce: the floods lift vp their waues.
\v 4 The waues of ye sea are marueilous through the noyse of many waters, yet the Lord on High is more mightie.
\v 5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holinesse becommeth thine House, O Lord, for euer.
