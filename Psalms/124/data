\c 124
\p
\v 1 A song of degrees, or Psalme of David. If the Lord had not bene on our side, (may Israel now say)
\v 2 If the Lord had not bene on our side, when men rose vp against vs,
\v 3 They had then swallowed vs vp quicke, when their wrath was kindled against vs.
\v 4 Then the waters had drowned vs, and the streame had gone ouer our soule:
\v 5 Then had the swelling waters gone ouer our soule.
\v 6 Praysed be the Lord, which hath not giuen vs as a praye vnto their teeth.
\v 7 Our soule is escaped, euen as a bird out of the snare of the foulers: the snare is broken, and we are deliuered.
\v 8 Our helpe is in the Name of the Lord, which hath made heauen and earth.
