\c 114
\p
\v 1 When Israel went out of Egypt, and the house of Iaakob from the barbarous people,
\v 2 Iudah was his sanctification, and Israel his dominion.
\v 3 The Sea sawe it and fled: Iorden was turned backe.
\v 4 The mountaines leaped like rams, and the hils as lambes.
\v 5 What ailed thee, O Sea, that thou fleddest? O Iorden, why wast thou turned backe?
\v 6 Ye mountaines, why leaped ye like rams, and ye hils as lambes?
\v 7 The earth trembled at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Iaakob,
\v 8 Which turneth the rocke into waterpooles, and the flint into a fountaine of water.
