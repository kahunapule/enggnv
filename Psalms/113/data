\v 1 Praise ye the Lord. Praise, O ye seruants of the Lord, prayse the Name of the Lord.
\v 2 Blessed be the Name of the Lord from hencefoorth and for euer.
\v 3 The Lordes Name is praysed from the rising of ye sunne, vnto ye going downe of the same.
\v 4 The Lord is high aboue all nations, and his glorie aboue the heauens.
\v 5 Who is like vnto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling on high!
\v 6 Who abaseth himselfe to beholde things in the heauen and in the earth!
\v 7 He raiseth the needie out of the dust, and lifteth vp the poore out of the dung,
\v 8 That he may set him with the princes, euen with the princes of his people.
\v 9 He maketh the barren woman to dwell with a familie, and a ioyfull mother of children. Prayse ye the Lord.
