\v 1 To him that excelleth upon Gittith. A Psalme committed to the sonnes of Korah. O Lord of hostes, howe amiable are thy Tabernacles!
\v 2 My soule longeth, yea, and fainteth for the courtes of the Lord: for mine heart and my flesh reioyce in the liuing God.
\v 3 Yea, the sparrowe hath found her an house, and the swallow a nest for her, where she may lay her yong: euen by thine altars, O Lord of hostes, my King and my God.
\v 4 Blessed are they that dwell in thine house: they will euer praise thee. Selah.
\v 5 Blessed is the man, whose strength is in thee, and in whose heart are thy wayes.
\v 6 They going through the vale of Baca, make welles therein: the raine also couereth the pooles.
\v 7 They goe from strength to strength, till euery one appeare before God in Zion.
\v 8 O Lord God of hostes, heare my prayer: hearken, O God of Iaakob. Selah.
\v 9 Beholde, O God, our shielde, and looke vpon the face of thine Anointed.
\v 10 For a day in thy courtes is better then a thousand other where: I had rather be a doore keeper in the House of my God, then to dwell in the Tabernacles of wickednesse.
\v 11 For the Lord God is the sunne and shielde vnto vs: the Lord will giue grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walke vprightly.
\v 12 O Lord of hostes, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
