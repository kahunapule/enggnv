\v 1 To him that excelleth. A song or Psalme. Rejoice in God, all ye inhabitants of the earth.
\v 2 Sing forth the glory of his name: make his praise glorious.
\v 3 Say vnto God, Howe terrible art thou in thy workes! through the greatnesse of thy power shall thine enemies be in subiection vnto thee.
\v 4 All the worlde shall worship thee, and sing vnto thee, euen sing of thy Name. Selah.
\v 5 Come and beholde the workes of God: he is terrible in his doing towarde the sonnes of men.
\v 6 He hath turned the Sea into drie land: they passe through the riuer on foote: there did we reioyce in him.
\v 7 He ruleth the worlde with his power: his eyes beholde the nations: the rebellious shall not exalt them selues. Selah.
\v 8 Prayse our God, ye people, and make the voyce of his prayse to be heard.
\v 9 Which holdeth our soules in life, and suffereth not our feete to slippe.
\v 10 For thou, O God, hast proued vs, thou hast tryed vs as siluer is tryed.
\v 11 Thou hast brought vs into the snare, and layed a strait chaine vpon our loynes.
\v 12 Thou hast caused men to ryde ouer our heads: we went into fire and into water, but thou broughtest vs out into a welthie place.
\v 13 I will go into thine House with burnt offrings, and will pay thee my vowes,
\v 14 Which my lippes haue promised, and my mouth hath spoken in mine affliction.
\v 15 I will offer vnto thee the burnt offerings of fat rammes with incense: I will prepare bullocks and goates. Selah.
\v 16 Come and hearken, all ye that feare God, and I will tell you what he hath done to my soule.
\v 17 I called vnto him with my mouth, and he was exalted with my tongue.
\v 18 If I regard wickednesse in mine heart, the Lord will not heare me.
\v 19 But God hath heard me, and considered the voyce of my prayer.
\v 20 Praysed be God, which hath not put backe my prayer, nor his mercie from me.
