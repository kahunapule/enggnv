\v 1 My soule, prayse thou the Lord: O Lord my God, thou art exceeding great, thou art clothed with glorie and honour.
\v 2 Which couereth himselfe with light as with a garment, and spreadeth the heauens like a curtaine.
\v 3 Which layeth the beames of his chambers in the waters, and maketh the cloudes his chariot, and walketh vpon the wings of the winde.
\v 4 Which maketh his spirits his messengers, and a flaming fire his ministers.
\v 5 He set the earth vpon her foundations, so that it shall neuer moue.
\v 6 Thou coueredst it with the deepe as with a garment: the waters woulde stand aboue the mountaines.
\v 7 But at thy rebuke they flee: at the voyce of thy thunder they haste away.
\v 8 And the mountaines ascend, and the valleis descend to the place which thou hast established for them.
\v 9 But thou hast set them a bounde, which they shall not passe: they shall not returne to couer the earth.
\v 10 He sendeth the springs into the valleis, which runne betweene the mountaines.
\v 11 They shall giue drinke to all the beasts of the fielde, and the wilde asses shall quench their thirst.
\v 12 By these springs shall the foules of the heauen dwell, and sing among the branches.
\v 13 He watereth the mountaines from his chambers, and the earth is filled with the fruite of thy workes.
\v 14 He causeth grasse to growe for the cattell, and herbe for the vse of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth,
\v 15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oyle to make the face to shine, and bread that strengtheneth mans heart.
\v 16 The high trees are satisfied, euen the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted,
\v 17 That ye birdes may make their nestes there: the storke dwelleth in the firre trees.
\v 18 The high mountaines are for the goates: the rockes are a refuge for the conies.
\v 19 He appoynted the moone for certaine seasons: the sunne knoweth his going downe.
\v 20 Thou makest darkenesse, and it is night, wherein all the beastes of the forest creepe forth.
\v 21 The lions roare after their praye, and seeke their meate at God.
\v 22 When the sunne riseth, they retire, and couche in their dennes.
\v 23 Then goeth man forth to his worke, and to his labour vntill the euening.
\v 24 O Lord, howe manifolde are thy workes! in wisdome hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
\v 25 So is this sea great and wide: for therein are things creeping innumerable, both small beastes and great.
\v 26 There goe the shippes, yea, that Liuiathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
\v 27 All these waite vpon thee, that thou maiest giue them foode in due season.
\v 28 Thou giuest it to them, and they gather it: thou openest thine hand, and they are filled with good things.
\v 29 But if thou hide thy face, they are troubled: if thou take away their breath, they dye and returne to their dust.
\v 30 Againe if thou send forth thy spirit, they are created, and thou renuest the face of the earth.
\v 31 Glory be to the Lord for euer: let the Lord reioyce in his workes.
\v 32 He looketh on the earth and it trembleth: he toucheth the mountaines, and they smoke.
\v 33 I will sing vnto the Lord all my life: I will prayse my God, while I liue.
\v 34 Let my wordes be acceptable vnto him: I will reioyce in the Lord.
\v 35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the wicked till there be no more: O my soule, prayse thou the Lord. Prayse ye the Lord.
