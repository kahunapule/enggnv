\c 96

\v 1 Sing vnto the Lord a newe song: sing vnto the Lord, all the earth.
\v 2 Sing vnto the Lord, and prayse his Name: declare his saluation from day to day.
\v 3 Declare his glory among all nations, and his wonders among all people.
\v 4 For the Lord is great and much to be praysed: he is to be feared aboue all gods.
\v 5 For all the gods of the people are idoles: but the Lord made the heauens.
\v 6 Strength and glory are before him: power and beautie are in his Sanctuarie.
\v 7 Giue vnto the Lord, ye families of the people: giue vnto the Lord glory and power.
\v 8 Giue vnto the Lord the glory of his Name: bring an offering, and enter into his courtes.
\v 9 Worship the Lord in the glorious Sanctuarie: tremble before him all the earth.
\v 10 Say among the nations, The Lord reigneth: surely the world shalbe stable, and not moue, and he shall iudge the people in righteousnesse.
\v 11 Let the heauens reioyce, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roare, and all that therein is.
\v 12 Let the field be ioyfull, and all that is in it: let all the trees of the wood then reioyce
\v 13 Before the Lord: for he commeth, for he cometh to iudge the earth: he wil iudge the world with righteousnes, and the people in his trueth.
