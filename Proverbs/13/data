\c 13
\p
\v 1 A wise sonne will obey the instruction of his father: but a scorner will heare no rebuke.
\v 2 A man shall eate good things by the fruite of his mouth: but the soule of the trespassers shall suffer violence.
\v 3 Hee that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life: but he that openeth his lips, destruction shall be to him.
\v 4 The sluggard lusteth, but his soule hath nought: but the soule of the diligent shall haue plentie.
\v 5 A righteous man hateth lying wordes: but the wicked causeth slander and shame.
\v 6 Righteousnesse preserueth the vpright of life: but wickednes ouerthroweth the sinner.
\v 7 There is that maketh himselfe riche, and hath nothing, and that maketh himselfe poore, hauing great riches.
\v 8 A man will giue his riches for the ransome of his life: but the poore cannot heare ye reproch.
\v 9 The light of the righteous reioyceth: but the candle of the wicked shall be put out.
\v 10 Onely by pride doeth man make contention: but with the well aduised is wisdome.
\v 11 The riches of vanitie shall diminish: but he that gathereth with the hand, shall increase them.
\v 12 The hope that is deferred, is the fainting of the heart: but when the desire commeth, it is as a tree of life.
\v 13 He that despiseth the worde, hee shall be destroyed: but hee that feareth the commandement he shalbe rewarded.
\v 14 The instruction of a wise man is as the welspring of life, to turne away from the snares of death.
\v 15 Good vnderstanding maketh acceptable: but the way of the disobedient is hated.
\v 16 Euery wise man will worke by knowledge: but a foole will spread abroade folly.
\v 17 A wicked messenger falleth into euill: but a faithfull ambassadour is preseruation.
\v 18 Pouertie and shame is to him that refuseth instruction: but hee that regardeth correction, shalbe honoured.
\v 19 A desire accomplished deliteth ye soule: but it is an abomination to fooles to depart from euil.
\v 20 He that walketh with the wise, shalbe wise: but a companion of fooles shalbe afflicted.
\v 21 Affliction followeth sinners: but vnto the righteous God will recompense good.
\v 22 The good man shall giue inheritance vnto his childrens children: and the riches of the sinner is layde vp for the iust.
\v 23 Much foode is in the fielde of the poore: but the fielde is destroyed without discretion.
\v 24 He that spareth his rodde, hateth his sonne: but he that loueth him, chasteneth him betime.
\v 25 The righteous eateth to the contentation of his minde: but the belly of the wicked shall want.
