\v 1 Bvt Iob answered and sayd,
\v 2 Though my talke be this day in bitternes, and my plague greater then my groning,
\v 3 Would God yet I knew how to finde him, I would enter vnto his place.
\v 4 I would pleade the cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
\v 5 I would knowe the wordes, that he would answere me, and would vnderstand what he would say vnto me.
\v 6 Would he plead against me with his great power? No, but he would put strength in me.
\v 7 There the righteous might reason with him, so I shoulde be deliuered for euer from my Iudge.
\v 8 Behold, if I go to the East, he is not there: if to the West, yet I can not perceiue him:
\v 9 If to the North where he worketh, yet I cannot see him: he wil hide himselfe in the South, and I cannot beholde him.
\v 10 But he knoweth my way, and trieth mee, and I shall come forth like the gold.
\v 11 My foote hath followed his steps: his way haue I kept, and haue not declined.
\v 12 Neyther haue I departed from the commandement of his lippes, and I haue esteemed the words of his mouth more then mine appointed foode.
\v 13 Yet he is in one minde, and who can turne him? yea, he doeth what his minde desireth.
\v 14 For he will performe that, which is decreed of me, and many such things are with him.
\v 15 Therefore I am troubled at his presence, and in considering it, I am afraid of him.
\v 16 For God hath softened mine heart, and the Almightie hath troubled me.
\v 17 For I am not cut off in darknesse, but he hath hid the darkenesse from my face.
