\c 6
\p
\v 1 Bvt Iob answered, and said,
\v 2 Oh that my griefe were well weighed, and my miseries were layed together in the balance.
\v 3 For it woulde be nowe heauier then the sande of the sea: therefore my wordes are swallowed vp.
\v 4 For the arrowes of the Almightie are in me, the venime whereof doeth drinke vp my spirit, and the terrours of God fight against me.
\v 5 Doeth the wilde asse bray when he hath grasse? or loweth the oxe when he hath fodder?
\v 6 That which is vnsauerie, shall it be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egge?
\v 7 Such things as my soule refused to touch, as were sorowes, are my meate.
\v 8 Oh that I might haue my desire, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
\v 9 That is, that God would destroy me: that he would let his hand go, and cut me off.
\v 10 Then should I yet haue comfort, (though I burne with sorowe, let him not spare) because I haue not denyed the wordes of the Holy one.
\v 11 What power haue I that I should endure? or what is mine end, if I should prolong my life?
\v 12 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brasse?
\v 13 Is it not so, that there is in me no helpe? and that strength is taken from me?
\v 14 He that is in miserie, ought to be comforted of his neighbour: but men haue forsaken the feare of the Almightie.
\v 15 My brethre haue deceiued me as a brook, and as the rising of the riuers they passe away.
\v 16 Which are blackish with yee, and wherein the snowe is hid.
\v 17 But in time they are dryed vp with heate and are consumed: and when it is hote they faile out of their places,
\v 18 Or they depart from their way and course, yea, they vanish and perish.
\v 19 They that go to Tema, considered them, and they that goe to Sheba, waited for them.
\v 20 But they were confounded: when they hoped, they came thither and were ashamed.
\v 21 Surely nowe are ye like vnto it: ye haue seene my fearefull plague, and are afraide.
\v 22 Was it because I said, Bring vnto me? or giue a rewarde to me of your substance?
\v 23 And deliuer me from the enemies hande, or ransome me out of the hand of tyrants?
\v 24 Teach me, and I wil hold my tongue: and cause me to vnderstande, wherein I haue erred.
\v 25 Howe stedfast are the wordes of righteousnes? and what can any of you iustly reproue?
\v 26 Doe ye imagine to reproue wordes, that the talke of the afflicted should be as the winde?
\v 27 Ye make your wrath to fall vpon the fatherlesse, and dig a pit for your friende.
\v 28 Nowe therefore be content to looke vpon me: for I will not lie before your face.
\v 29 Turne, I pray you, let there be none iniquitie: returne, I say, and ye shall see yet my righteousnesse in that behalfe. Is there iniquitie in my tongue? doeth not my mouth feele sorowes?
