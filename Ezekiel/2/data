\v 1 And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, stand vp vpon thy feete, and I wil speake vnto thee.
\v 2 And the Spirite entred into me, when he had spoken vnto me, and set me vpon my feete, so that I heard him that spake vnto me.
\v 3 And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: for they and their fathers haue rebelled against me, euen vnto this very day.
\v 4 For they are impudent children, and stiffe hearted: I do send thee vnto them, and thou shalt say vnto them, Thus saith the Lord God.
\v 5 But surely they will not heare, neither in deede will they cease: for they are a rebellious house: yet shall they knowe that there hath bene a Prophet among them.
\v 6 And thou sonne of man, feare them not, neither be afraide of their wordes, although rebels, and thornes be with thee, and thou remainest with scorpions: feare not their wordes, nor be afrayde at their lookes, for they are a rebellious house.
\v 7 Therefore thou shalt speake my words vnto them: but surely they will not heare, neither will they in deede cease: for they are rebellious.
\v 8 But thou sonne of man, heare what I say vnto thee: be not thou rebellious, like this rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eate that I giue thee.
\v 9 And when I looked vp, beholde, an hande was sent vnto me, and loe, a roule of a booke was therein.
\v 10 And he spred it before me, and it was written within and without, and there was written therein, Lamentations, and mourning, and woe.
