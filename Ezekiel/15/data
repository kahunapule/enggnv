\c 15

\v 1 And thee word of the Lord came vnto me, saying,
\v 2 Sonne of man, what commeth of the vine tree aboue all other trees? and of the vine braunch, which is among the trees of ye forest?
\v 3 Shall wood bee taken thereof to doe any worke? or wil men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
\v 4 Behold, it is cast in the fire to be consumed: the fire consumeth both the endes of it, and the middes of it is burnt. Is it meete for any worke?
\v 5 Behold, when it was whole, it was meete for no worke: how much lesse shall it bee meete for any worke, when the fire hath consumed it, and it is burnt?
\v 6 Therefore thus sayth the Lord God, As the vine tree, that is among the trees of the forest, which I haue giuen to the fire to be consumed, so will I giue the inhabitants of Ierusalem.
\v 7 And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall consume them: and ye shall know, that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them,
\v 8 And when I make the lande waste, because they haue greatly offended, saith the Lord God.
