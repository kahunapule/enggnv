\c 13
\p
\v 1 Though I speake with the tongues of men and Angels, and haue not loue, I am as sounding brasse, or a tinkling cymbal.
\v 2 And though I had the gift of prophecie, and knewe all secrets and all knowledge, yea, if I had all faith, so that I could remooue mountaines and had not loue, I were nothing.
\v 3 And though I feede the poore with all my goods, and though I giue my body, that I be burned, and haue not loue, it profiteth me nothing.
\v 4 Loue suffreth long: it is bountifull: loue enuieth not: loue doeth not boast it selfe: it is not puffed vp:
\v 5 It doeth no vncomely thing: it seeketh not her owne things: it is not prouoked to anger: it thinketh not euill:
\v 6 It reioyceth not in iniquitie, but reioyceth in the trueth:
\v 7 It suffreth all things: it beleeueth all things: it hopeth all things: it endureth all things.
\v 8 Loue doeth neuer fall away, though that prophecyings be abolished, or the tongues cease, or knowledge vanish away.
\v 9 For we knowe in part, and we prophecie in part.
\v 10 But when that which is perfect, is come, then that which is in part, shalbe abolished.
\v 11 When I was a childe, I spake as a childe, I vnderstoode as a childe, I thought as a childe: but when I became a man, I put away childish thinges.
\v 12 For nowe we see through a glasse darkely: but then shall wee see face to face. Nowe I know in part: but then shall I know euen as I am knowen.
\v 13 And nowe abideth faith, hope and loue, euen these three: but the chiefest of these is loue.
