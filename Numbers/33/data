\v 52 Ye shall then driue out all the inhabitants of the land before you, and destroy all their pictures, and breake asunder all their images of metall, and plucke downe all their hie places.
\v 53 And ye shall possesse the lande and dwell therein: for I haue giue you ye land to possesse it.
\v 54 And ye shall inherite the land by lot according to your families: to the more yee shall giue more inheritance, and to the fewer the lesse inheritance. Where the lot shall fall to any man, that shall be his: according to the tribes of your fathers shall ye inherite.
\v 55 But if ye will not driue out the inhabitants of the land before you, then those which yee let ramaine of them, shalbe prickes in your eyes, and thornes in your sides, and shall vexe you in the land wherein ye dwell.
\v 56 Moreouer, it shall come to passe, that I shall doe vnto you, as I thought to do vnto them.
