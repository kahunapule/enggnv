\v 1 Bvt speake thou the thinges which become wholesome doctrine,
\v 2 That the elder men be watchful, graue, teperate, sounde in the faith, in loue, and in patience:
\v 3 The elder women likewise, that they be in such behauiour as becommeth holinesse, not false accusers, not subiect to much wine, but teachers of honest things,
\v 4 That they may instruct the yong women to be sober minded, that they loue their husbands, that they loue their children,
\v 5 That they be temperate, chaste, keeping at home, good and subiect vnto their husbands, that the word of God be not euill spoken of.
\v 6 Exhort yong men likewise, that they bee sober minded.
\v 7 In all things shewe thy selfe an ensample of good woorkes with vncorrupt doctrine, with grauitie, integritie,
\v 8 And with the wholesome woorde, which can not be condemned, that hee which withstandeth, may be ashamed, hauing nothing concerning you to speake euill of.
\v 9 Let seruants be subiect to their masters, and please them in al things, not answering again,
\v 10 Neither pickers, but that they shew al good faithfulnesse, that they may adorne the doctrine of God our Sauiour in all things.
\v 11 For that grace of God, that bringeth saluation vnto all men, hath appeared,
\v 12 And teacheth vs that we should denie vngodlinesse and worldly lusts, and that we should liue soberly and righteously, and godly in this present world,
\v 13 Looking for that blessed hope, and appearing of that glorie of that mightie God, and of our Sauiour Iesus Christ,
\v 14 Who gaue him selfe for vs, that hee might redeeme vs from all iniquitie, and purge vs to bee a peculiar people vnto himselfe, zealous of good woorkes.
\v 15 These things speake, and exhort, and conuince with all authoritie. See that no man despise thee.
